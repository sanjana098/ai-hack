The targeted sample is 240 adolescents in grades 9-12 with persistent, elevated mental health difficulties and associated impact. Participants will receive either a brief problem-solving intervention delivered by lay counsellors (intervention), or enhanced usual care comprised of problem-solving booklets (control). Self-reported adolescent mental health difficulties and idiographic problems will be assessed at 6 weeks (co-primary outcomes) and again at 12 weeks post-randomization. In addition, adolescent-reported impact of mental health difficulties, perceived stress, mental wellbeing and clinical remission, as well as parent-reported adolescent mental health difficulties and impact scores, will be assessed at 6 and 12 weeks post-randomization. Parallel process evaluation, including estimations of the costs of delivering the interventions, will be conducted.","detailedDescription":"Background and rationale:\n\nThis study is part of a larger research program called PRIDE (PRemIum for aDolEscents) for which the goals are to:\n\n* develop a trans-diagnostic, stepped-care intervention targeting common mental disorders in school-going adolescents in India; and\n* evaluate its effectiveness in reducing symptom severity and improving recovery rates among adolescent participants\n\nThe components of the stepped-care intervention will be evaluated in separate, linked studies. The main aim of the current trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of a low-intensity problem-solving intervention (the first step of the PRIDE stepped-care intervention) delivered by school counsellors for adolescents with common mental health problems, when compared with enhanced usual care (EUC).\n\nThe primary hypothesis is that the intervention will be superior to the EUC control condition in reducing the severity of self-reported mental health symptoms and prioritized problems at six weeks post-randomization.\n\nStudy design and setting:\n\nThis is a parallel-arm, individually randomized controlled trial with equal allocation of participants between arms. The trial will be conducted in six Government-run secondary schools (Grade 9 to 12; approximately corresponding to 13-20 years of age) from the National Capital Territory of Delhi, India. A process evaluation will be nested in the trial to provide findings that will assist in the interpretation of the trial results and to inform potential implementation of the PRIDE intervention on a wider scale.\n\nEligibility criteria: see 'Eligibility' section.\n\nInterventions: see 'Arms and Interventions' section.\n\nScreening measures: Referred adolescents will be screened for common mental health difficulties, impact and chronicity using the SDQ (Goodman et al., 2000), according to the eligibility criteria set out below.\n\nSociodemographic information: This will be obtained from all enrolled participants through an interviewer-administered questionnaire, with responses entered directly into a tablet computer.\n\nOutcome measures: see 'Outcome Measures' section.\n\nEconomic measures: The costs associated with the introduction of the experimental and control arm interventions will be estimated by adding the personnel costs for counsellors and supervisors, together with fixed costs of training (venue/per diem), furniture and supplies. All costs will be reported in Indian Rupees and then converted to US Dollars at the average daily exchange rate over the preceding 12 months.\n\nProcess measures:\n\nProcess data on enrollment, randomization and assessment procedures will be obtained from researcher-completed record forms. These will be collated to obtain assent/consent rates of adolescents and parents (and reasons for missing assent/consent); randomization rates (and reasons for randomization errors); completion rates of baseline and follow-up outcome assessments (and reasons for non-completion); and time lags between intended and completed assessments (and reasons for deviating from targets). In addition, motivations for help-seeking and expectancies for the school counselling program will be explored at the time of eligibility assessment through a brief qualitative interview with a sub-sample of referred students.\n\nIntervention processes will be assessed using additional data sources. Counsellor-completed session record forms will be used to obtain process data on duration, spacing and frequency of attended sessions (and reasons for non-attendance); and intervention uptake and completion rates (and reasons for pre-intervention and mid-intervention drop-out). Participants' adherence to treatment and potential engagement challenges will be assessed using checklists within the same record forms, indicating whether or not the student completed practice exercises at home, used the POD (Problems-Options-Do it yourself) booklets at home, brought the POD booklets to the session, and demonstrated understanding of POD booklets and session content. Use of POD booklets will be assessed in each arm of the trial at 6- and 12-week follow-up assessments using a brief adolescent-reported measure that asks about estimated frequency of home use and perceived helpfulness of POD booklets in the preceding 6 weeks. Service satisfaction data will also be obtained from participants in each trial arm at 12 weeks using the 8-item Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8) (Larsen et al., 1979). Supplementary questions will elicit open-ended written feedback on the most helpful aspects of the available intervention and suggested modifications.\n\nIntervention fidelity will be assessed using independent ratings of audio-recorded sessions: 10% of all recordings will be selected at random and rated by a psychologist who is not directly involved with supervision of the intervention providers.\n\nSample size:\n\nSample size estimations have been produced for two co-primary outcomes: mental health symptoms (SDQ Total Difficulties score) and idiographic problems (YTP score). A Bonferroni correction has been used to adjust for multiple primary outcomes. Following pilot work that indicated large (uncontrolled) effect sizes, the investigators have conservatively assumed that the intervention will be associated with an effect size of 0.5 (difference in means/SD) on both the primary outcomes with 90% power at 6 weeks post-randomization. The investigators have also assumed a loss to follow up of 15% over 6 weeks, based on pilot work. Based on these assumptions and a 1:1 allocation ratio for individual randomization, a total of 240 participants will be required. This sample size provides 80% power to detect an ES of 0.44.\n\nRecruitment methods and sampling frame:\n\nA combination of whole-school and classroom-based sensitization methods will be used to generate referrals into the trial. This will include posters, teacher briefings and classroom-based information sessions for students. Referrals may be initiated in a number of ways: (1) adolescents can directly approach a researcher following a classroom information session; (2) adolescents can provide their contact details in a 'drop box' placed in the school; or (3) adolescents can request a referral through a teacher (or a teacher may raise the prospect of referral directly with a student before initiating the same). Referred participants will be assessed for eligibility using the SDQ; those meeting eligibility criteria will be invited to participate in the trial. Referred adolescents who do not meet eligibility criteria will receive a handout on self-care strategies.\n\nIn the academic year 2018-19, there are 172 class divisions of grades 9-12 in the six collaborating schools in New Delhi, and approximately 50 students per class. Seventy classes will participate in an embedded recruitment trial (see separate protocol: NCT03633916). The host intervention trial will recruit participants originating from the 70 classes sampled in the embedded recruitment trial, as well as participants drawn from other classes as needed. The precise schedule of recruitment activities in the remaining 102 classes will be calibrated according to referral patterns and caseload capacity for intervention providers in the various schools.\n\nAssent/consent procedures:\n\nReferred adolescents will be invited to meet with a researcher when a 2-stage consent process will be initiated.\n\n1. Assent/consent for using screening data: All referred students who are screened for eligibility will be provided with written information and structured verbal information about the potential use of their screening data for evaluation of help-seeking patterns. Assent, consent will be obtained on signed consent forms.\n2. Assent/consent for trial participation: Eligible students will be provided with additional structured verbal information and a printed participant information sheet about trial participation. Assent will be sought for adolescents who are below 18 years of age, and consent will be sought for adolescents who are 18 years of age or older. For assenting participants aged below 18 years of age, consent from a parent/guardian will be sought by a researcher. This will involve two levels of consent: consent for their child to participate in the trial, and consent for a parent's/guardian's own participation in the study. The informed assent/consent procedure with adolescents will be completed during school hours, while the parent/guardian consent process will be completed at the family's home or another convenient location. Details of assenting/consenting adolescents and consenting parents (and those declining to participate) will be logged on an ongoing basis, along with reasons for non-participation.\n\nData collection procedures (see 'Outcome Measures' for detailed descriptions of measures referenced below):\n\nField researchers will administer outcome measures in schools, at home or other convenient locations. The adolescent-reported SDQ will be collected by a field researcher on a digital tablet device, and will also serve as the basis for eligibility screening. Other baseline assessments will be completed as soon as possible after assent/consent procedures are completed (and ideally on the same day). The YTP will be administered on paper while the remaining scales will be administered on a digital tablet device. The YTP will be administered on paper as it asks the participants to describe, prioritize and score their three main problems; the same list of problems will be rated again during follow-up assessments (see below). Adolescents will also be assessed on the PSS-4 and SWEMWBS. Index parents will be invited to complete the SDQ only. Sociodemographic data from the adolescent and parent/guardian will also be collected on digital tablets.\n\nFollow-up assessments will be completed at 6 and 12 weeks post-randomization. The 6-week outcome is the primary end-point, as the optimal effect of the intervention is expected to occur immediately after the intervention has been completed. The 12-week end-point is included to evaluate the durability of intervention effects. The CSQ-8 (a process measure of service satisfaction) will be collected at 12 weeks post-randomization only. Additionally, all adolescents will complete a self-report measure on the use of the intervention materials (problem-solving booklets) provided in the intervention and control arms.\n\nData analysis plan:\n\nDescriptive analyses: Initial analyses will compare baseline characteristics of referred adolescents who did and did were not enrolled into the trial for various reasons. Baseline characteristics of enrolled participants will be compared between trial arms. Findings will be reported as per the CONSORT guidelines, using intention-to-treat analysis, including a trial flow chart.\n\nOutcome measures will be summarized at recruitment, at 6- and 12-week follow up by trial arm, and overall. These will be summarized by means (standard deviation), medians (interquartile range), or numbers and proportions as appropriate. For continuous outcomes, histograms will also be plotted within each arm to assess how closely the scales follow a normal distribution. This will determine how the outcomes are described as well as the choice of inferential analysis method.\n\nOutcome analyses: The primary analyses will be on an intention-to-treat basis at the 6-week end-point, adjusted for baseline values of the outcome measure; school (as a fixed effect in the analysis) to allow for within-school clustering, counsellor variation (as a random effect); and variables for which randomization did not achieve reasonable balance between the arms at baseline, or those associated with missing outcome data. Intervention effects will be presented as adjusted mean differences and effect sizes (ES), defined as standardized mean differences.\n\nFor continuous variables, the analysis of secondary and exploratory outcomes will use similar methods to the primary outcome analysis for continuous variables. For the binary outcome (remission), the intervention effect will be reported as the adjusted odds ratio with 95% CIs. Generalized (linear or logistic) random-effects regression models will be used, adjusting for baseline outcome score and clustering, and other baseline variables as above. For outcomes to be examined over the 12-week follow-up period (other than remission), regression models will include a variable to represent 'time' in order to indicate whether the data were collected at the 6- or 12-week end-point. To assess whether the intervention effect varies over time, an intervention x time interaction term will be fitted to allow for a different intervention effect at 6 vs 12 months, although this will not be highly powered.\n\nWe will explore potential moderators of intervention effects, with respect to a priori defined modifiers (i.e. chronicity of mental health difficulties, severity of mental health difficulties, YTP type, SDQ caseness profile). We will fit relevant interaction terms and test for heterogeneity of intervention effects in regression models. A mediation analysis will be conducted to examine whether the theoretically-driven a priori factor (perceived stress at 6 weeks) mediates the effects of the intervention on primary outcomes (i.e. mental health symptoms and idiographic problems) at 12 weeks. Additionally, intervention effects for students who receive fewer sessions than prescribed will be estimated using the Complier Average Causal Effect structural equation model.\n\nProcess evaluation: We will undertake descriptive statistical analysis of quantitative process data in order to explore the implementation of intervention procedures. In addition, thematic analysis will be used to code and organise qualitative interview data on intervention expectancies (assessed prior to enrolment) and qualitative written feedback on service satisfaction (assessed at 12-week follow-up). Findings from the various data sources will be triangulated and used to develop explanatory hypotheses about potential differences in intervention delivery and engagement across schools, subgroups of participants and providers. Process evaluation findings will be used to facilitate interpretation of the main trial results. The trial statisticians may conduct further analyses to test hypotheses generated from integration of the process evaluation and trial outcome data.\n\nCost-effectiveness analysis: The costs associated with the introduction of the PRIDE and control arm interventions will be estimated by adding the fixed costs of materials and personnel costs."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Mental Health Issue (E.G., Depression, Psychosis, Personality Disorder, Substance Abuse)"],"keywords":["Adolescents"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"A two-arm, individually randomized controlled trial with equal allocation of participants between arms.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"The randomization list will be generated by an independent statistician.

Although common cold is a self-limiting disease, symptoms such as runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, cough, sore throat, are troublesome.\n\nDry nose is characterized by nasal mucosa dryness, itching, mild burning, crusting, and dehydrated mucus. Causes of dry nose sensation include climatic factors, dry room air, workplace conditions, allergic rhinitis, endonasal sinus surgery.\n\nDry nose symptoms occur concurrently and may be the first signs of a common cold infection and rhinitis sicca (also known atrophic rhinitis).\n\nSaline nasal sprays are broadly used as first-line treatment to relieve nasal congestion or nasal dryness. Isotonic saline solutions preferentially aim at cleansing and moistening of the nasal mucosa and thus are suitable for treatment of dry nose symptoms. Hypertonic saline solutions are generally used for decongestion of the nasal mucosa.\n\nFor these reasons, an interventional, non-comparative, single-center Post Marketing Clinical Follow-up (PMCF) study was planned to evaluate the performance and safety of \"NASAL SPRAYS\" used to relieve nasal congestion and dryness.\n\nThe objectives of the PMCF study are confirmation of the performance, collection of additional safety data regarding expected adverse events and detection of potential unexpected adverse events associated with the use of \"NASAL SPRAYS\" according to the instruction for use (IFU).\n\nEach pediatric subject whose parent(s)/legal guardian signed an Informed Consent Form (ICF), and each adult subject after signing the ICF, will enter the screening and baseline phase (the 2 visits will coincide) during which baseline procedures will be completed.\n\nAt baseline visit (V0), one of the \"NASAL SPRAYS\" will be administered to the enrolled subject.\n\nThe patient will perform 2 on-site visits: V0 and V2/EOS. To monitor the safety, 1 phone contact is planned (V1) to check for potential adverse events and concomitant medications intake.\n\nThe first administration and the intervals at which the treatment should be repeated, to be done as per Investigator judgment and according to the IFU, depend on various factors regarding the physiology of the patients (e.g. nasal congestion/ obstruction, sneezing), the age of the patient, and for pediatric subjects, their birth characteristics (e.g. age, prematurity, birthweight)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Nasal Congestion","Nasal Dryness"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":105,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Nasal spray treatment arm","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: Nasal sprays with sea salts"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Nasal sprays with sea salts","interventionMappedName":[],"description":"Nasal sprays for nasal congestion and dryness","armGroupLabels":["Nasal spray treatment arm"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in nasal symptoms:To evaluate the performance of the \"NASAL SPRAYS\" used to relieve nasal congestion and dryness, through Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for assessment of nasal symptoms","description":"Visual Analogue Scale:\n\nMinimum value = 0; Maximum value = 10; Higher scores mean a better outcome.","timeFrame":"From baseline (V0 = Day 0) to 10 days (EOS/V2 - Day 10 ± 1)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the \"NASAL SPRAYS\" through visual nasal examination and assessment of AEs including the relationship of the AE to the IP (e.g. local allergic reaction)","timeFrame":"End of study visit (EOS/V2 - Day 10 ± 1)"},{"measure":"Change in Quality of life: to evaluate the capability of the \"NASAL SPRAYS\" to improve the (QoL), through Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for assessment of QoL","description":"Visual Analogue Scale:\n\nMinimum value = 0; Maximum value = 10; Higher scores mean a better outcome.","timeFrame":"End of study visit (EOS/V2 - Day 10 ± 1)"},{"measure":"To evaluate the parent(s), children or adults' satisfaction of the \"NASAL SPRAYS\" through a 5-points Likert scale","timeFrame":"End of study visit (EOS/V2 = Day 10 ± 1)"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Pediatric subjects whose ICF will be signed by parent(s) or legal guardian;\n* Adults' ICF signed;\n* M \\& F infants (6-23 months), children (2-11 years), or M \\& F Aged ≥ 18 years at the time of the signature of the ICF;\n* Infants, children or adults presenting with nasal congestion and/or nasal dryness.\n* Willingness not to use other nasal sprays during the entire study.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Suspected other - different - conditions involving the respiratory tract (e.g. asthma, pneumonia);\n* Suspected or known hypersensitivity or allergy to Investigational Product (IP) components;\n* Suspected alcohol or drug abuse;\n* Other clinically significant and uncontrolled pathologies that may interfere with study results (e.g. cystic fibrosis);\n* Participation in another investigational study;\n* Parent(s)' and/or patient's inability to follow all study procedures, including attending all site visits, tests and examinations;\n* Parent(s)' and/or patient's mental incapacity that precludes adequate understanding or cooperation.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"6 Months","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Nicola Lombardo","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+39 3313803904","email":"nlombardo@unicz.it"}],"locations":[{"facility":"U.O.C otorinolaringoiatria, Policlinico Mater Domini","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Catanzaro","state":"CZ","zip":"88100","country":"Italy","contacts":[{"name":"Nicola Lombardo","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+39 3313803904","email":"nlombardo@unicz.it"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":38.88247,"lon":16.60086}}],"locations_nested":[{"facility":"U.O.C otorinolaringoiatria, Policlinico Mater Domini","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Catanzaro","state":"CZ","zip":"88100","country":"Italy","contacts":[{"name":"Nicola Lombardo","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+39 3313803904","email":"nlombardo@unicz.it"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":38.88247,"lon":16.60086}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2023-06-15","modelPredictions":{"bmiLimits":{"minBmi":0.00,"maxBmi":101.00}}},"conditionBrowseModule":{},"interventionBrowseModule":{}},"hasResults":false},

The major risk factor for HIV acquisition among AA women is high-risk heterosexual sex, including unprotected vaginal and anal sex, and sex with a high-risk partner. Hazardous alcohol use has been associated with high risk sexual behaviors and prevalent gonorrhea among women attending an urban STI clinic, both of which increase a woman's vulnerability to HIV acquisition and transmission. This application proposes a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a culturally tailored computer-directed brief alcohol intervention (CBI) enhanced with cell-phone booster calls using interactive voice response technology (IVR) and text messages among HIV-infected and at-risk AA women attending an urban STI Clinic. Hazardous drinking AA women (N=450) presenting with STI complaints will be randomized to one of three arms: 1) usual clinical care, 2) clinic-based, CBI, or 3) clinic-based, CBI + 3 booster calls using IVR and text messages. The CBI, an evidence-based based method for behavior change, will use principles of motivational interviewing, to counsel on: 1) alcohol use and 2) associated HIV/STI risk behaviors. Primary outcomes, measured at 3, 6, and 12 month intervals, include alcohol-related risk behaviors (number of binge drinking episodes, drinking days/week, and drinks per occasion), sexual risk behaviors (number of partners, episodes of unprotected vaginal/anal sex, episodes of sex while high), and occurrence of HIV/STI biomarkers. Prior to implementing the RCT, the CBI and IVR software messages will be revised to: 1) include the association between hazardous alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors, and 2) ensure their relevance and acceptability using quantitative/qualitative feedback from a sample of AA women attending a Baltimore City STI clinic. The proposed research focuses on a particularly vulnerable population of urban HIV at-risk and HIV-infected AA women seeking treatment in a public STI clinic and examines two novel BI intervention delivery strategies specifically tailored to be culturally/socially relevant to this minority population. If the intervention(s) prove to be effective, study findings will offer \"real life\" specialty care clinics a screening and intervention package that is practical, low cost, and easy to implement."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Alcohol; Harmful Use","Binge Drinking","Risk Behavior","HIV Infection"],"keywords":["Hazardous alcohol use","Binge drinking","High risk sexual behaviors","HIV risk reduction"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":439,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Computerized Brief Alcohol Intervention + IVR","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Computer-delivered brief alcohol intervention (CBI) with booster phone calls delivered by IVR+ text messages (TM)","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Computerized brief alcohol intervention + IVR booster calls"]},{"label":"Computerized Brief Alcohol Intervention","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Computerized Brief Alcohol Intervention only (CBI)","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Computerized brief alcohol intervention"]},{"label":"Attention Control","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Attention control","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Attention Control"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Computerized brief alcohol intervention + IVR booster calls","interventionMappedName":[],"description":"1) Computerized brief alcohol intervention + IVR booster calls: Clinic-based computerized brief alcohol intervention (delivered once) followed by three booster phone calls using interactive voice response technology + text messages","armGroupLabels":["Computerized Brief Alcohol Intervention + IVR"],"otherNames":["CBI+IVR+TM"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Computerized brief alcohol intervention","interventionMappedName":[],"description":"Computerized brief alcohol intervention: Clinic based computer delivered brief alcohol intervention delivered one time","armGroupLabels":["Computerized Brief Alcohol Intervention"],"otherNames":["CBI"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Attention Control","interventionMappedName":[],"description":"Attention Control: 20 minute attention control condition focused on dental hygiene delivered once","armGroupLabels":["Attention Control"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Alcohol Use (Heavy Drinking Days)","description":"Change in alcohol-related risk behavior as assessed by the number of heavy drinking days.","timeFrame":"Baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months"},{"measure":"Change in Alcohol Use (Drinking Days)","description":"Change in alcohol-related risk behavior as assessed by the number of drinking days.","timeFrame":"Baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months"},{"measure":"Change in Alcohol Use (Drinks Per Drinking Day)","description":"Change in alcohol-related risk behavior as assessed by the standard drinks per drinking day.","timeFrame":"Baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months"},{"measure":"Change in Alcohol Use (Drinks Per Week)","description":"Change in alcohol-related risk behavior as assessed by the standard drinks per week.","timeFrame":"Baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. 18 years of age or older;\n2.

The role of the Pharmacist is ever evolving and expanding to meet the needs of their clients including comprehensive medication therapy management and expanded preventative expert. Community pharmacists are one of the most accessible health care professionals and provide a wide range of clinical services in the neighborhoods, towns, and cities across this province.\n\nAs part of the Manitoba government's wellness initiative, the government is strategically committed towards reducing the use of tobacco through public policy. Smoking is one of the leading causes of death in Manitoba and the use of tobacco is responsible for more than 50% of lung, respiratory, and oral cancers and a substantial factor in cardiovascular disease. While decreases in smoking rates have been achieved in recent years, Manitoba continues to exceed the national average of 17.3%, ranking the province with the third highest smoking prevalence. Manitoba' current smoking rates warrant continued efforts to reduce smoking in youth and adults.\n\nWhile many believe smoking to be lifestyle choice it is also known to be a changeable lifestyle behavior and a significant determinant of health. It is also known to be a serious addiction that is very difficult to overcome both physically and emotionally. As part of Manitoba's targeted approach to smoking cessation, a partnership has been forged to develop and implement the pilot program: Manitoba Pharmacist Initiated Smoking Cessation Program.\n\nMethodology The role of the pharmacist can best be described as underutilized and often an under recognized resource in smoking cessation programs. For individuals who smoke, many find smoking cessation overwhelming and difficult without assistance, including smoking cessation drugs and ongoing support and counselling. Many pharmacists have received additional knowledge and training specifically for initiating and monitoring a smoking cessation for individual clients. The Manitoba Pharmacist Smoking Cessation Program will provide access for 100 clients to the vital components necessary to quit smoking. Lower socioeconomic status is associated with higher rates of smoking. The Manitoba Employment and Income Assistance program provides support for lower income individuals in Manitoba. This smoking cessation program is a controlled pilot study providing clients with the most appropriate smoking cessation drugs along with the benefit of one to one pharmacist support and counselling.\n\nSmoking Cessation Program Objectives\n\nThe following are the program objectives:\n\n* Establish a provincial pilot smoking cessation program\n* Reduce the number of Manitobans who smoke\n* Enhance utilization of the pharmacist in preventative health care delivery\n\nProgram Scope A. Target Population\n\n* 100 Manitoba residents over the age of 18 who are Manitoba Employment and Income Assistance active program participants as of January 01, 2014\n* Provide written consent to participate in a smoking cessation program\n* Agree to participate in the counselling sessions and smoking cessation behavior readiness\n* Agree to participate in an evaluative process and follow up study\n\nB. Participation Provider (Pharmacy and pharmacist)\n\n1. Pharmacy/Pharmacists - Up to fifteen pharmacies throughout Manitoba who employ pharmacists professionally trained in QUIT and/or Catalyst, have previous experience providing smoking cessation services to patients, who are willing and able to commit to pilot project timelines, and who receive pharmacy manager approval will be eligible to apply to participate in this program.\n2. In December 2013, MPhA will distribute application forms to each pharmacy for their voluntary consideration for participation and response to the call for applications. Each application form consists of a letter of introduction to explain the program and application process, a pharmacist manager application form, and pharmacist application form(s). The MPhA is the provincial regulatory body for pharmacists and pharmacies in Manitoba and thus has access to all pharmacy contact information. MPhA has agreed to utilize their mailing list and distribution system to communicate with all pharmacies in the province to ensure that equal access to any pharmacy and pharmacist in the province is achieved.\n3. The Steering Committee will establish a Pharmacy Selection Sub-Committee to confidentially review all application forms for completeness and to select suitable complete a random selection process of all complete and eligible applications.\n4. Up to 15 pharmacies in Manitoba who meet the provider eligibility criteria will be selected by the Pharmacy Selection Sub-Committee. All applicants will receive an outcome letter from the Program Manager following the selection process.\n5. Successful pharmacy applicants will receive an orientation training program in the first week of January 2014 to share and educate pilot project details, participant recruitment processes, program implementation processes, methodology to complete participant informed consent and program surveys, evaluation requirements, and professional pharmacy reimbursement processes, and participant product reimbursement options.\n\nClient Participation\n\n1. Eligible participants in the pilot project include and Manitoba adult who meets the criteria of the targeted population cohort, and who have identified as being ready to quit smoking, will be eligible for the program.\n2. Pharmacists participating as providers in the smoking cessation pilot project will be responsible for identifying eligible adults within their patient population as eligible for program participation.\n3. All pharmacists in Manitoba are PHIA compliant.\n4. Pharmacist providers will share with each potential participant a program information sheet, informed consent form, and access to a pharmacy staff person (pharmacy assistant/technician) not related to the pilot project and Pilot Project Project Manager contact information for access to pilot project information and independent decision making for project participation.\n5.

Additional Educational materials will be provided as needed (Managing Withdrawal Symptoms, Minimizing Weight Gain, Dealing with the Urge to Smoke, Managing Slips and Relapse, List of Resources).\n\n4. Ensure the participant has a copy of the Smoking Cessation Assessment From for future telephone follow-ups.\n\nvi. Phone Follow-up - 1 Week Post Quit\n\n1. The pharmacist will provide telephone follow-up and review what has worked well and any challenges with withdrawal they have experienced. The Quit Plan will be modified as needed.\n2. They will complete the Smoking Cessation Assessment Form with the patient. vii. 1 Month Post Quit Visit\n\n1. The pharmacist will meet with the participant and review what has worked well and any challenges with withdrawal they have experienced. The Quit Plan will be modified as needed.\n\n2. They will complete the Smoking Cessation Assessment Form with the patient. viii. 3 Month Quit Visit\n\n1. The pharmacist will meet with the participant and review what has worked well and any challenges with withdrawal they have experienced. The Quit Plan will be modified as needed.\n2. They will complete the Smoking Cessation Assessment Form with the patient.\n3. Ensure the participant has a copy of the Smoking Cessation Assessment From for future telephone follow-ups.\n\nix. Phone Follow-up - 6 Month Post Quit\n\n1. The pharmacist will provide telephone follow-up and review what has worked well and any challenges with withdrawal they have experienced. The Quit Plan will be modified as needed.\n2. They will complete the Smoking Cessation Assessment Form with the patient.\n3. Make a transition plan to ensure the participant has access to remaining to necessary support and suitable covered medications to maintain smoking cessation.\n\nC. Program Duration Total duration of the study will be a 6-15 months. The participant will have access to smoking cessation pharmacy counseling services and smoking cessation products for a period of three months from the initiation in the pilot project. The intervention component of the pilot project will be available between January and April 2015."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Smoking Cessation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":119,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Pharmacist - Smoking Cessation Support'","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Active Comparator Arm Receive smoking assessment Initial Smoking Cessation Counselling Smoking Cessation Prescription/Non-Prescription Product as required Follow-up Counselling","interventionNames":["Other: Pharmacist - Smoking Cessation Support"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Pharmacist - Smoking Cessation Support","description":"Intervention mirrors clinical practice with smoking cessation counselling -- patients receive smoking cessation product at no cost and pharmacists are paid flat fee for providing counselling","armGroupLabels":["Pharmacist - Smoking Cessation Support'"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Smoking Cessation Assessment","description":"Self-reported Smoking Cessation on Standardized Form","timeFrame":"6 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Smoking Cessation Assessment","description":"Self-reported Smoking Cessation on Standardized Form","timeFrame":"1 month"},{"measure":"Smoking Cessation Assessment","description":"Self-reported Smoking Cessation on Standardized Form","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"Smoking Cessation Product","description":"Smoking Cessation Product Used and Cost","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"Quit Diary","description":"Record of Continued Smoking and Symptoms","timeFrame":"6 months"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Cigarettes Smoked","description":"# of cigarettes smoked","timeFrame":"day 0, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months"},{"measure":"Pharmacist Time","description":"Time spent by pharmacists in counselling patients","timeFrame":"6 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* smoker\n* \\>= 18 years\n* receiving Manitoba Employment and Income Assistance as of January 1st 2015\n* Stated desire to quit smoking\n* Signed Consent with associated agreement to participate in evaluation and follow-up\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* \\< 18\n* Not on Income Assistance\n* Current non-smoker","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Shawn C Bugden, PharmD","affiliation":"College of Pharmacy, University of Manitoba","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"College of Pharmacy, University of Manitoba","city":"Winnipeg","state":"Manitoba","zip":"R6M 1L4","country":"Canada","geoPoint":{"lat":49.8844,"lon":-97.14704}}],"locations_nested":[{"facility":"College of Pharmacy, University of Manitoba","city":"Winnipeg","state":"Manitoba","zip":"R6M 1L4","country":"Canada","geoPoint":{"lat":49.8844,"lon":-97.14704}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2023-06-15","modelPredictions":{"bmiLimits":{"minBmi":0.00,"maxBmi":101.00}}},"conditionBrowseModule":{},"interventionBrowseModule":{}},"hasResults":false},

This study will draw on both existing and new samples from JME patients. These will be compared to anonymised data from samples for 2000 controls. The goal of this study is to find the genetic cause of JME.

There are over 30 types of epilepsy, some common, some rare. Most epilepsies arise in childhood and have a genetic cause. Approximately 40% of patients have the common forms of Genetic Generalised Epilepsy (GGE), and the commonest GGE is \"Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy\" or JME.\n\nThe goal of this study is to find the genetic cause for JME. The investigators will do this by comparing the genetic code in JME patients with that in people who do not have epilepsy. This study will use clues from their electroencephalograph or brainwave test that is used to help diagnose epilepsy. Participants will provide a single blood sample, along with permission to collect clinical data about their diagnosis and a copy of their clinical EEG. There is no direct benefit or risk to the research participants but the results from this study may help other people with epilepsy or brain impairments in the future.\n\nThere is overwhelming evidence that JME is caused by changes in genetic code. These changes are likely to be found in more than just one gene and there may be more than one type of change. In order to find these changes, this study will look at a large number of people with JME and compare their genetic code with people who do not have epilepsy. Finding the causes of JME will lead to better understanding of its cause, new treatments, and tailoring of treatments according to a person's genetic make-up."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy"],"keywords":["JME","Epilepsy","Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy","Genomewide Association Study","Genetics"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"OTHER"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Whole blood"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients diagnosed with JME","description":"People who meet the eligibility requirements and have been diagnosed with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.","interventionNames":["Other: Blood draw"]},{"label":"Controls","description":"People without a lifetime history of seizures.","interventionNames":["Other: Existing samples"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Blood draw","description":"Participation includes one visit for one blood draw per recruited patient. 10-20ml peripheral venous blood will be taken from the antecubital fossa.

Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is an anti-HIV drug approved for use in the United States for the treatment of HIV infected adults. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and blood levels of TDF in HIV infected pregnant women and their babies. The study will be conducted at sites in Malawi and Brazil.","detailedDescription":"Rates of MTCT of HIV have dramatically decreased in resource-rich countries since the introduction of antiretroviral (ARV) prophylaxis; increased prenatal care, HIV testing, and counseling; elective cesarean delivery; and avoidance of breastfeeding. In resource-limited countries, however, MTCT of HIV continues to be a widespread problem. In these parts of the world, ARV prophylaxis is too expensive and too difficult to adequately administer; mothers often do not receive proper prenatal care; cesarean delivery may pose risks to the mother and and her infant; and due to the lack of safe, affordable, and socially acceptable alternatives, HIV infected mothers breastfeed their infants. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of TDF in HIV infected pregnant women and their infants.\n\nParticipants in this study will be enrolled through 12 months after delivery. During the last trimester of pregnancy, HIV infected women will be screened for eligibility. Women will be enrolled into the study upon presentation at the study site for delivery. Standard of care with ARVs for prevention of MTCT will be offered to all women and their infants both inside and outside of the study; however, such ARVs will not be provided by this study.\n\nThere will be four cohorts in this study:\n\n* Cohort 1 women will receive a single dose of TDF (SD TDF) during active labor. Cohort 1 women will be hospitalized at the delivery facility through Day 3 postpartum.\n* Cohort 2 women will not receive any TDF. Cohort 2 women will be hospitalized at the delivery facility through Day 7 postpartum. Their infants will receive TDF at birth and on Days 3 and 5 after birth.\n* Cohort 3 will not begin enrolling women until data safety evaluations of Cohorts 1 and 2 are completed. Cohort 3 women will be hospitalized at the delivery facility through Day 7 postpartum. Women in Cohort 3 will receive SD TDF during active labor, and their infants will receive TDF at birth and on Days 3 and 5 after birth.\n* Cohort 4, which was added to the study based on a review of data from the other cohorts, will be similar to Cohort 3, except that infants will receive daily TDF for the 7 days after birth. Researchers believe this higher and more frequent dosing of TDF in infants will help them meet the target TDF concentration specified in the protocol.\n\nThere will be seven study visits for women at study entry (Day 0), Day 2, between Days 5 and 7, at Weeks 6 and 12, and at Months 6 and 12 postpartum. Medical history, a short physical exam, and blood collection will occur at all visits. In Cohorts 1, 3, and 4, blood collection for PK studies will occur prior to receiving TDF and seven times post-dose.\n\nThere will be eight study visits for infants, which will occur within 24 hours of birth; on Day 3; between Days 5 and 7; at Weeks 6 and 12; and at Months 6, 9, and 12. Medical history, a physical exam, and blood collection will occur at all visits. Infants will have x-rays to assess bone health at Day 3 and Month 3, except in Cohort 4, which will not include x-rays of infants. Infants of Cohort 1 will have blood collection for PK studies at birth and four times after birth. Infants of Cohorts 2 and 3 will undergo blood collections for PK studies at birth, Day 3, and Day 5. Blood collection at these visits will occur before receiving TDF and 2 and 10 hours after receiving TDF. At birth, an additional collection will occur 18 to 24 hours after receiving TDF, and on Day 5, two additional collections will occur--at 18 to 24 hours and at 36 to 48 hours after receiving TDF. Infants of Cohort 4 will have blood collection for PK studies at birth and after their fourth and seventh doses of TDF."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["HIV Infections"],"keywords":["Perinatal Transmission","MTCT","HIV Seronegativity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":122,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Pregnant participants will receive a single dose of TDF during active labor.

Low-cost and evidence-based health promoting public health tools are urgently needed in Norwegian municipalities, to meet both current and future challenges with mental health and wellbeing. The aim in this randomized controlled trail is to test if a shorter, 10 week web-based version (The Five Ways to All, \"5WaysA\"), of an already established course (Five Ways to Wellbeing course), can promote wellbeing and mastery in the general population. The principal investigator will investigate to what extend the effects are short-term and long-term (i.e., 10 weeks, 18 weeks and 12 months after starting to receive the 5WaysA intervention).","detailedDescription":"Background:\n\nThe need for effective, low-cost and evidence-based tools to prevent illness and promote health in the population is paramount. Norway, along with other countries in the Western world, is currently facing major health and welfare-related challenges. Demographic changes, lifestyle related diseases and work absence are threatening the sustainability of the Norwegian welfare state. Non-communicable diseases, including mental illness, currently account for 65% of the total disease burden in Norway and 50% of Norwegians are likely to meet diagnostic criteria for a mental disorder some time during their life span. Traditional treatment and care options tend to be costly and time consuming, and to depend on highly skilled specialist human resources. Systematic findings also indicate that population-based (i.e., universal, targeting the general population) measures often result in larger population health gains than selective and indicated measures targeting only those with excess risk. According to the paradox of prevention, when disease risk is common, universal interventions directed towards the whole population before illness occurs, are more effective than interventions targeting high risk groups after symptoms have emerged. The Covid-19 pandemic and associated social distancing measures have corroborated the need for digital solutions. Web-based interventions may reach a large number of participants, utilizing a very modest amount of both human and financial resources.\n\nThe aim:\n\nThis study aims to test a potentially effective low-cost health and wellbeing promotive web-based intervention targeting the general population in Norwegian municipalities. The intervention is based on the Five Ways to Wellbeing framework developed for British health authorities in 2008. This framework, and the intervention to be tested, provides participants with knowledge on simple, sustainable activities that may strengthen their subjective wellbeing (SWB), mastery, health and social relations, thereby also reducing the risk of common mental health problems such as depression and anxiety. The study will be conducted in close collaboration with municipal stakeholders and important user groups. Thus, the principal investigator (PI) will investigate effects of a low-cost health and wellbeing promotive public health tool based on the evidence-base of Five Ways to Wellbeing. To date, nobody has tested the Five Ways-concept in such a format. Proved effective, this web-based 5WaysA intervention, may have a significant impact on the public health of inhabitants in the municipalities.\n\nMain hypothesis:\n\nThe web-based intervention 5WaysA will improve wellbeing and mastery and hence provide the municipalities with an effective measure for mental health promotion.\n\nResearch questions:\n\n1. To what extent does participation in the web-based 5WaysA intervention lead to improved wellbeing, mental health and mastery in the general population?\n2. To what extent are the effects short-term and long-term (i.e., 10 weeks, 18 weeks and 12 months after starting to receive the 5WaysA intervention)?\n3. What mechanisms explain potential improvements in wellbeing?\n\n   1. For whom is this intervention effective (i.e., is the effect moderated by e.g. gender, age, education)?\n   2. What mechanisms (e.g., regular practicing of 5Ways actions, increased social activity or support) explain intervention effects?\n\nSample and recruitment:\n\nThe PI plan to recruit a minimum of 1500 participants from the general population in Norwegian municipalities. The participants will be randomized to either an intervention group (n=750), or to one of two wait-list control groups (active control, n=375) (inactive control, n =375). The wait-list control groups will receive the intervention three to five months later. The PI expect high drop-out (up to 50 %) since this has been the situation in other studies investigating online interventions in a general population. The PI is also unsure about how much time the municipalities have to help PI with the recruitment process, because of a high work load in the municipalities during the pandemic of Covid-19.\n\nNote (June 19, 2021): PI was only able to recruit 226 participants in spring 2021. PI will continue the recruitment process and do another round of the intervention in fall 2021. This will not be registered as a new study, and is regarded as part of the current study\n\nProcedures:\n\nThe web-based 10 week intervention consist of one main webinar (two hours at Zoom), a booster session webinar five weeks later and SMS messages twice a week in the the six following weeks. The webinars will be live lectures with an independent trained facilitator. The SMS messages will be sent out by the PI (via Nettskjema) to all participants while they are in the interventions period. Questionnaires will be administrated and distributed by the PI by using the Nettskjema and Services for sensitive data (TSD) tools. The measurements will also be conducted use of Nettskjema and TSD.\n\nPower analysis:\n\nThe PI assume that we can recruit a minimum of 1500 participants, but high drop-out is expected. An a priori power analysis was conducted using G\\*Power3 to test the interaction effect in a mixed ANOVA, using a two-tailed test, assuming a small effect size (f = .10), and an alpha of .05. The assumed effect size (f=0.1) was chosen as it is of the same magnitude (lower bound) as has been reported by other universal interventions with wellbeing as the outcome measure. The result showed that if PI attained a total sample of 750 participants at the second measurement point (attrition of 50%), PI would have power of .999 to detect a group by time interaction. The high level of statistical power will enable PI to investigate both moderators and mediators of the treatment effect."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Wellbeing","Health Attitude","Quality of Life"],"keywords":["Wellbeing","Health promotion","Web-based intervention"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"The design is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with one intervention group and two wait-list control groups.

CAD patients implanted with stent including bare metal stent (BMS) and drug eluting stent (DES) are recommended to receive dual anti-platelet treatment (DAPT), i.e. clopidogrel along with aspirin, for at least one year to reduce the incidence of ST by up-to-date guidelines. However, due to the variability of anti-platelet effect of clopidogrel, regular dose (75 mg daily) of clopidogrel administered cannot achieve enough inhibition of platelet aggregation in 20-30% of total patients, which is named as clopidogrel low responsiveness (CLR), and the morbidity of thrombosis (including) in CAD patients is still 10%.\n\nTicagrelor, a cyclopentyl-triazolo-pyrimidine, is a more potent adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor antagonist with faster onset and more significantly higher inhibition of platelet aggregation compared with clopidogrel and directly acts on P2Y12-ADP receptor in platelets without process of hepatic metabolism. In the PLATO study, ticagrelor plus reduced the remarkable incidence of cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) without significant higher incidence of major bleeding events compared with clopidogrel plus aspirin. Surprisingly, the incidence of death due to cardiovascular causes and the total fatality was decreased in patients with ticagrelor plus aspirin compared with those with clopidogrel plus aspirin. The results suggested the more benefit brought by ticagrelor, highlighting the wide use of it in the future.\n\nDue to the potent anti-platelet effect of ticagrelor, more bleeding events may occur. Additionally, when facing the need for cardiac or non-cardiac operation, occurrence of life-threatening bleeding event or necessity of emergency operation, doctors may be confused of the treatment for the patients taking ticagrelor, of which the half-life period is 8-9 hours and it suggests the importance of studying the reversal of the anti-platelet effects of ticagrelor.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to investigate the proportion of untreated donor platelets required to fully reverse the platelet inhibitory effects of aspirin and ticagrelor in healthy persons and patients with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and receiving ticagrelor.\n\nStudy Population:\n\nThe investigators design two cohort studies, and plan to enroll 32 healthy volunteers in cohort 1 and 16 patients with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and receiving dual anti-platelet therapy (ticagrelor 90mg bid + aspirin 100mg daily) for 7 days\n\nCohort 1:\n\nRandomization:\n\nA total of 32 healthy volunteers are planned to be enrolled and will be randomly divided into three groups: single anti-platelet treatment group (A group, 8 of 32), dual anti-platelet treatment group (B group, 8 of 32) and control group (C group, 16 of 32).\n\n1. Single anti-platelet treatment group: (Ticagrelor 90mg bid) × 7 days\n2. Dual anti-platelet treatment group: (Ticagrelor 90mg bid + Aspirin 100mg daily) × 7 days\n3.

Allergy or intolerance to aspirin or ticagrelor;\n2. Subjects at a high risk of bleeding (e.g. platelet count\\<100×10\\^9/L, history of peptic ulcer, hemoglobin\\<110g/L);\n3. Subjects with bronchial asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;\n4. Subjects with bradycardia (e.g. sick sinus syndrome, high-grade atrioventricular block, history of syncope with unproved uncorrelation with bradycardia);\n5. Smokers;\n6. Subjects with diabetes mellitus;\n7. Subjects planning to be pregnancy;\n8. Subjects with hepatic or renal dysfunction;\n9. Subjects who have taken other anti-platelet drugs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or proton pump inhibitors before scanning or need to take them during study period.\n\nBlood collection and sample preparation\n\nVenous blood samples are collected by venipuncture into two 4.5-mL draw BD vacutainer tubes containing 0.105M buffered sodium citrate (3.2%) at 08.00 hours in the morning before taking the agent and after the last dose of the study drug. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) from subjects in A group is mixed with increasing proportions of that in C group, with one untreated subject serving as the control for one treated subject. The proportion of control platelets mixed with inhibited platelets is calculated based on platelet numbers, starting at 10% and increasing by 10% increments. So as the PRP in B group.\n\nTest:\n\n1. Before taking the agent:\n\n   1. ADP-induced platelet aggregation: light transmittance aggregation (LTA) in response to 5μM ADP\n   2. Arachidonic acid (AA)-induced platelet aggregation: LTA in response to 1mM AA\n2. After 7-day medication:\n\n   1. ADP-induced platelet aggregation: LTA in response to 5μM ADP\n   2.
