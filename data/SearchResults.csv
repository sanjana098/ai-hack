NCT03630471,Effectiveness of a Problem-solving Intervention for Common Adolescent Mental Health Problems in India,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03630471,PRIDE,COMPLETED,"We will conduct a two-arm individually randomized controlled trial in six Government-run secondary schools in New Delhi. The targeted sample is 240 adolescents in grades 9-12 with persistent, elevated mental health difficulties and associated impact. Participants will receive either a brief problem-solving intervention delivered by lay counsellors (intervention), or enhanced usual care comprised of problem-solving booklets (control). Self-reported adolescent mental health difficulties and idiographic problems will be assessed at 6 weeks (co-primary outcomes) and again at 12 weeks post-randomization. In addition, adolescent-reported impact of mental health difficulties, perceived stress, mental wellbeing and clinical remission, as well as parent-reported adolescent mental health difficulties and impact scores, will be assessed at 6 and 12 weeks post-randomization. Parallel process evaluation, including estimations of the costs of delivering the interventions, will be conducted.",NO,"Mental Health Issue (E.G., Depression, Psychosis, Personality Disorder, Substance Abuse)",BEHAVIORAL: PRIDE 'Step 1' problem-solving intervention|BEHAVIORAL: Enhanced usual care,"Mental health symptoms, The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a 25-item self-report measure of youth mental health symptoms (Goodman et al., 2000). A Total Difficulties score is derived by summing items from four problem subscales (Emotional, Conduct, Hyperactivity/inattention and Peer problems). The measure is the most widely used clinical and research instrument in the field of child and adolescent mental health globally. The Hindi version will be used in complementary forms for self-report by adolescents and parents. The adolescent-reported SDQ Total Difficulties score (at 6-week end-point) will be a co-primary outcome, while the corresponding caregiver-reported SDQ Total Difficulties score will be an exploratory outcome., 6 weeks|Idiographic problems, The Youth Top Problems (YTP) is a brief, idiographic measure which identifies, prioritizes and scores respondents' three main problems (Weisz et al., 2011). Each nominated problem is scored from 0 ('not a problem') to 10 ('huge problem'). A mean severity score is calculated by summing individual problem scores and then dividing by the number of nominated problems. The YTP will be used to assess problems that other scales might address generally or otherwise miss; while providing a sensitive measure of specific priorities of the participant within a larger array of problems., 6 weeks","Mental health symptoms, The adolescent-reported SDQ Total Difficulties score at 12 weeks will be a secondary outcome, while the corresponding caregiver-reported SDQ Total Difficulties score will be an exploratory outcome., 12 weeks post-randomization|Idiographic problems, The adolescent-reported YTP severity score at 12 weeks will be a secondary outcome., 12 weeks post-randomization|Impact of mental health problems, The SDQ Impact Supplement measures distress and functional impairment associated with index mental health problems identified on the main SDQ scale. The adolescent-reported SDQ Impact Supplement score will be a secondary outcome, while the corresponding caregiver-reported SDQ Impact Supplement score will be an exploratory outcome., 12 weeks post-randomization|Internalising symptoms, Adolescent-reported internalising symptoms will be assessed as a secondary outcome using the combined peer and emotional problem sub-scales of the SDQ. The corresponding caregiver-reported SDQ Internalising score will be an exploratory outcome., 12 weeks post-randomization|Externalising symptoms, Adolescent-reported externalising symptoms will be assessed as a secondary outcome using the combined conduct and hyperactivity problem sub-scales of the SDQ. The corresponding caregiver-reported SDQ Externalising score will be an exploratory outcome., 12 weeks post-randomization|Prosocial behaviour, Adolescent-reported prosocial behaviour will be assessed as an exploratory outcome using the prosocial sub-scale of the SDQ., 12 weeks post-randomization|Perceived stress, The adolescent-reported Perceived Stress Scale-4-item version (PSS-4) will be used as a secondary outcome measure to assess the perception of stress, reflecting the degree to which situations are appraised as stressful during the preceding month (Cohen et al., 1983). This measure was chosen because of its relevance as a presumed mechanism of change within the problem-solving intervention, consistent with stress-coping theory (Lazarus \& Folkman, 1984). It has been translated into Hindi and used in a number of surveys and as an outcome measure in trials around the world (Lee, 2012)., 12 weeks post-randomization|Mental wellbeing, The adolescent-reported Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (SWEMWBS) will be used as a secondary measure to assess mental wellbeing (Stewart-Brown et al., 2009), which has been closely linked with social factors such as peer bullying and perception of school connectedness (Patalay \& Fitzsimons; 2016). It may therefore be especially amenable to problem-solving around common life difficulties encountered by school-going adolescents. The SWEMWBS is widely used internationally (Stewart-Brown, 2013) and a Hindi version is available., 12 weeks post-randomization|Clinical remission, This secondary outcome will be defined as falling below baseline eligibility cut-offs on both the SDQ Total Difficulties scale and Impact Supplement (i.e. SDQ Total Difficulties score in normal range and Impact score in the normal or borderline range)., 12 weeks post-randomization",,Sangath,Harvard Medical School (HMS and HSDM)|London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT",NA,250,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",SANPRIDE_002,2018-08-20,2019-01-20,2019-02-28,2018-08-14,,2019-05-21,"Sangath, New Delhi, Delhi, 110016, India",Statistical Analysis Plan
NCT05843071,"PMCF Study to Evaluate Performance and Safety of ""NASAL SPRAYS "" Used to Relieve Nasal Congestion and Dryness",https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05843071,,RECRUITING,"Acute viral upper respiratory tract infection, also known as common cold, is the most frequently observed infectious disease in human beings. Although common cold is a self-limiting disease, symptoms such as runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, cough, sore throat, are troublesome.

Dry nose is characterized by nasal mucosa dryness, itching, mild burning, crusting, and dehydrated mucus. Causes of dry nose sensation include climatic factors, dry room air, workplace conditions, allergic rhinitis, endonasal sinus surgery.

Dry nose symptoms occur concurrently and may be the first signs of a common cold infection and rhinitis sicca (also known atrophic rhinitis).

Saline nasal sprays are broadly used as first-line treatment to relieve nasal congestion or nasal dryness. Isotonic saline solutions preferentially aim at cleansing and moistening of the nasal mucosa and thus are suitable for treatment of dry nose symptoms. Hypertonic saline solutions are generally used for decongestion of the nasal mucosa.

For these reasons, an interventional, non-comparative, single-center Post Marketing Clinical Follow-up (PMCF) study was planned to evaluate the performance and safety of ""NASAL SPRAYS"" used to relieve nasal congestion and dryness.

The objectives of the PMCF study are confirmation of the performance, collection of additional safety data regarding expected adverse events and detection of potential unexpected adverse events associated with the use of ""NASAL SPRAYS"" according to the instruction for use (IFU).

Each pediatric subject whose parent(s)/legal guardian signed an Informed Consent Form (ICF), and each adult subject after signing the ICF, will enter the screening and baseline phase (the 2 visits will coincide) during which baseline procedures will be completed.

At baseline visit (V0), one of the ""NASAL SPRAYS"" will be administered to the enrolled subject.

The patient will perform 2 on-site visits: V0 and V2/EOS. To monitor the safety, 1 phone contact is planned (V1) to check for potential adverse events and concomitant medications intake.

The first administration and the intervals at which the treatment should be repeated, to be done as per Investigator judgment and according to the IFU, depend on various factors regarding the physiology of the patients (e.g. nasal congestion/ obstruction, sneezing), the age of the patient, and for pediatric subjects, their birth characteristics (e.g. age, prematurity, birthweight).",NO,Nasal Congestion|Nasal Dryness,DEVICE: Nasal sprays with sea salts,"Change in nasal symptoms:To evaluate the performance of the ""NASAL SPRAYS"" used to relieve nasal congestion and dryness, through Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for assessment of nasal symptoms, Visual Analogue Scale:

NCT01125371,Computerized Brief Alcohol Intervention (BI) for Binge Drinking HIV At-Risk and Infected Women,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01125371,,COMPLETED,"African American (AA) women are disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDs. The major risk factor for HIV acquisition among AA women is high-risk heterosexual sex, including unprotected vaginal and anal sex, and sex with a high-risk partner. Hazardous alcohol use has been associated with high risk sexual behaviors and prevalent gonorrhea among women attending an urban STI clinic, both of which increase a woman's vulnerability to HIV acquisition and transmission. This application proposes a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a culturally tailored computer-directed brief alcohol intervention (CBI) enhanced with cell-phone booster calls using interactive voice response technology (IVR) and text messages among HIV-infected and at-risk AA women attending an urban STI Clinic. Hazardous drinking AA women (N=450) presenting with STI complaints will be randomized to one of three arms: 1) usual clinical care, 2) clinic-based, CBI, or 3) clinic-based, CBI + 3 booster calls using IVR and text messages. The CBI, an evidence-based based method for behavior change, will use principles of motivational interviewing, to counsel on: 1) alcohol use and 2) associated HIV/STI risk behaviors. Primary outcomes, measured at 3, 6, and 12 month intervals, include alcohol-related risk behaviors (number of binge drinking episodes, drinking days/week, and drinks per occasion), sexual risk behaviors (number of partners, episodes of unprotected vaginal/anal sex, episodes of sex while high), and occurrence of HIV/STI biomarkers. Prior to implementing the RCT, the CBI and IVR software messages will be revised to: 1) include the association between hazardous alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors, and 2) ensure their relevance and acceptability using quantitative/qualitative feedback from a sample of AA women attending a Baltimore City STI clinic. The proposed research focuses on a particularly vulnerable population of urban HIV at-risk and HIV-infected AA women seeking treatment in a public STI clinic and examines two novel BI intervention delivery strategies specifically tailored to be culturally/socially relevant to this minority population. If the intervention(s) prove to be effective, study findings will offer ""real life"" specialty care clinics a screening and intervention package that is practical, low cost, and easy to implement.",YES,Alcohol; Harmful Use|Binge Drinking|Risk Behavior|HIV Infection,BEHAVIORAL: Computerized brief alcohol intervention + IVR booster calls|BEHAVIORAL: Computerized brief alcohol intervention|BEHAVIORAL: Attention Control,"Change in Alcohol Use (Heavy Drinking Days), Change in alcohol-related risk behavior as assessed by the number of heavy drinking days., Baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months|Change in Alcohol Use (Drinking Days), Change in alcohol-related risk behavior as assessed by the number of drinking days., Baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months|Change in Alcohol Use (Drinks Per Drinking Day), Change in alcohol-related risk behavior as assessed by the standard drinks per drinking day., Baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months|Change in Alcohol Use (Drinks Per Week), Change in alcohol-related risk behavior as assessed by the standard drinks per week., Baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months",,,Johns Hopkins University,National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA),FEMALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,439,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",NIAAAGC018632|R01AA018632,2011-10,2016-06-07,2016-06-07,2010-05-18,2022-06-01,2022-06-24,"Baltimore City Health Department STD Clinic, Baltimore, Maryland, 21205, United States",Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan

Background: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is associated with an increased risk of poor sleep quality, excessive daytime sleepiness and prolonged reaction time, which can elevate the risk for traffic accidents. Increased morbidity and three to four times increased mortality in these patients are well documented, mainly in the cardiovascular field. Pharyngeal surgery, i.e. uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) opens up the airway and was the predominant treatment for OSAS worldwide before continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices became widely available in the 1990s. Since then, the main treatment for OSAS has been CPAP, but an increasing number of patients are also treated with mandibular retaining device (MRD). UPPP as treatment for OSAS has been performed for 30 years. The evidence-grade for the efficacy has so far been very low, and the side-effects and complication rate has raised the question whether there is a place for surgical treatment of OSAS. However, the compliance for CPAP and dental devices are quite low (50-60%), leaving a lot of patients untreated if surgery is not offered.

* How prostate cancer develops
* Why some cancer cells spread and others do not
* Why some cancer cells respond to treatment and others do not

Researchers and doctors know that 1 in 3 of the male population over the age of 50 has cancer cells in their prostate. However, most of these men will never know they have it and it will not affect their quality of life or their life expectancy. However, some cancers can be aggressive. These are more likely to spread outside of the prostate and cause problems. Doctors do not have an accurate way to tell the difference between aggressive cancer and those which will not cause any problems. Even within one prostate some tumours are aggressive and others do not cause a problem during the lifetime of a patient. In fact, even within one tumour, different cells may behave differently. In other words, one part of the tumour may be aggressive and spread, whilst another part of the same tumour does not. This project will try to find out more about what makes different tumours and different parts of the same tumour aggressive or harmless.

It is important to find out what makes some cancer cells spread and others stay where they are. For the investigators to do this they need to collect fresh samples of cancer tissue from the prostate and from different areas of a tumour within the prostate. This is because biopsies used to diagnose or exclude cancer by the hospital laboratory are not good enough to give investigators detailed genetic information. These biopsies have been put into a chemical called formalin which reduces the quality of the genetic information.

Investigators are therefore asking patients who are undergoing prostate biopsies as part of their normal care to allow them to take additional biopsies for the purpose of this study. This may be the first time patients are having biopsies. Or, patients may be having biopsies after treatment that has been given for the cancer and the doctors are concerned the treatment is not working.",NO,PROSTATE CANCER,PROCEDURE: Targeted biopsies of the prostate,"Tumour heterogeneity, To define the extent of inter/intra-tumour heterogeneity and its association with disease stage at diagnosis and Gleason grade by deep genomic sequencing of multiple regions of intermediate Gleason grade tumours and high Gleason grade tumours, with and without metastatic disease., At time of biopsy|Clonal origin of secondary tumours, Through clonal re-ordering and multi-regional prostate mapping, determine whether satellite tumour nodules in high grade prostate cancers represent monoclonal disease related to the index lesion or the evolution of polyclonal cancers by evaluating the deep genomic signatures of primary and secondary lesions within the prostate, At time of biopsy|Relationship of tumours to metastases, Identify genotype requirements for metastasis development by deep sequencing DNA from the associated metastases from the same patient to reconstruct clonal evolution from primary tumour to metastatic sites and identify evolutionary bottlenecks governing metastasis development that may be targetable for clinical benefit., At time of biopsy","Identifying genomic signature of tumour DNA in blood, To determine whether ultra-deep sequencing of circulating plasma DNA can reconstruct inter/intra-tumour heterogeneity and clonal evolution occurring in men who have failed first- and second-line therapies (for localized and metastatic disease)., At time of biopsy|Genomic signature changes in tumour DNA in blood when drug resistance develops, To determine whether ultra-deep sequencing of circulating plasma DNA can reconstruct inter/intra-tumour heterogeneity and clonal evolution occurring during the acquisition of castration resistant disease., At time of biopsy|Relationship of tumour genomics with imaging, To determine the association of inter/intra-tumour heterogeneity with functional imaging with multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging, At time of biopsy",,University College London Hospitals,,MALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE1|PHASE2,50,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: DIAGNOSTIC,13/0244,2014-09,2016-06,2016-06,2013-12-27,,2017-05-10,"University College London Hospitals, London, NW1 2BU, United Kingdom",

Most Hong Kong people are having sedentary lifestyle. Researchers show that the increase of physical activity reduces the risk of chronic diseases, and improve cardio-pulmonary functions; whereas sedentary behaviors increase the risks.

For many people, the targets of the WHO physical activity guidelines are too high to be achieved. Some people are not even willing to try, despite the evidence for the protective benefits to their long term health. In response, a recent focus has been placed upon reduction of sedentary behavior. Sedentary behavior is defined as 'those activities that do not increase energy expenditure substantially above the resting level, such as sitting, lying down, or viewing TV, or simply as ""too much sitting"". The primary determinants of sedentary behavior are behavioral and context-based, such as TV and screen-focused behaviors in home and work environments, sitting at work, and sitting during transport.

NCT05078671,"Pharmacokinetic Boosting of Olaparib to Improve Exposure, Tolerance and Cost-effectiveness",https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05078671,PROACTIVE,RECRUITING,"Olaparib is a poly-adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, originally used for the maintenance treatment of women with platinum-sensitive relapsed breast cancer gene (BRCA)-mutated high grade serious epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer, who are in response to platinum-based chemotherapy. Over the last two years, several therapeutic indications have been added to the drug label, such as first-line platinum-sensitive BRCA-mutated high grade serious epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer, germline BRCA1/2-mutated, human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2-)negative, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer and BRCA1/2-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, who have progressed following prior therapy. Since olaparib is very expensive, this increase of treatment population will have a significant impact on health care expenditures.

To keep healthcare affordable and accessible for all patients, innovative strategies are warranted to reduce the dose of expensive drugs, without reduction of efficacy. For olaparib, pharmacokinetic (PK) boosting can be applied. PK boosting is the lay term for administering a non-therapeutic active strong inhibitor of a metabolic enzyme, for example the cytochrome p450 enzyme 3A (CYP3A), together with a therapeutic drug that is metabolized by the same enzyme. Boosting thus increases the concentration of the therapeutic drug and allows lower doses to be administered to patients. Hence, coadministration of a reduced dose of olaparib with cobicistat, a non-therapeutic, strong inhibitor of the CYP3A can lead to equivalent exposure to olaparib. Furthermore, inhibition of CYP3A could lead to less PK variability since metabolic capacity is a prominent cause for (intra- and inter-individual) variability in systemic exposure. Predictable olaparib exposure will reduce the number of patients who are unintentionally under- or overtreated. Lastly, tumor tissue itself may express CYP3A as a detoxification or resistance mechanism. Theoretically, PK boosting may also overcome CYP3A-mediated drug resistance.

The purpose of this study is to establish the efficacy, safety and feasibility of co-administering olaparib with the PK booster cobicistat with the aim to implement boosting approach for olaparib in routine practice.

According to The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Child physical abuse CPA is defined as ""The intentional use of physical force against a child that result in, or has the potential to result in, physical injury"".

Child abuse and neglect may occur in any family, and it isn't confined to certain geographic, ethnic, or socioeconomic background. According to World Health Organization (WHO) estimation, around forty million children suffer from different forms of abuse, and require health and social care.

WHO has estimated that in year 2000 nearly fifty-seven thousand children under fifteen years old were dead because of abuse, with the highest rate in children between zero to four years old. In 2014, WHO estimated that 23% of children worldwide were subjected to physical abuse.

Dentists are the best to detect children who are at abuse risk, since more than fifty percent of abuse injuries occur at head and neck region, and they are the first to see and treat orofacial region. Studies have shown that while dentists are in a good position to detect and report abuse, few of them do report abuse cases.

The main causes of not reporting CPA are lack of adequate history, inability, and hesitancy in diagnosing the abuse, fear that it may affect the reputation of their clinic, worry about what will happen to the child and his family, and unfamiliarity with child protection policy in their workplace.

The Egyptian law obligates dentists to report any suspected case of child abuse. Many studies have been published assessing dentists' knowledge and practice of CPA diagnosis and reporting.

NCT04970771,Solving Wellness: An Initiative to Enhance Canadian Healthcare Provider Wellness,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04970771,,RECRUITING,"Given the high incidence of burnout, depression, and suicidal ideation among Canadian healthcare providers (HCPs), there is an urgent need to support wellness through strengthening peer networks and engaging key stakeholders. This project will explore the capacity of digital tools to educate HCPs and enable them to support their mental health. The investigators will evaluate specific research questions: Are HCPs more aware of their wellness needs? Did burnout and stress decrease? Do HCPs feel more supported by their peers? The overarching objective is to contribute towards a culture prioritizing HCP wellbeing. The investigators hope to achieve this through two outcome-oriented objectives: 1) to create resources to promote HCP wellbeing and 2) to foster a web-based HCP community. This initiative integrates big data tools, interactive online content, and the Solving Healthcare podcast to improve HCP wellness. It is anticipated that HCPs will become more aware of their wellness needs, and once they are able to identify strategies to live healthier work lives, cultural changes will take place, leading to a new attitude surrounding HCP mental health. To complete these objectives, resources will be drawn from the HELP-MD physician database and an advisory circle, and will be disseminated via a web platform and the widely known Solving Healthcare podcast.

PIV failures often occur when fluids leak out of the vein into surrounding tissue. This failure is usually called infiltration if the leakage involves non-vesicant solutions or extravasation in case of vesicant solutions. In this clinical study both infiltration and extravasation events are indicated by the term ""infiltration"".

neonatal intensive care unit patients are an high-risk population for infiltration due to their intrinsic characteristic: poor and fragile vein asset, frequent and uncontrolled movements, need for prolonged intravenous drug and fluid administration. Current nursing practice involves regular PIV site assessments for continuous infusions; particular attention is payed to the identification of swelling, pain, redness, warmth, or coolness. As infiltration represents a leading cause of iatrogenic injury, an early identification, an early identification can minimize its consequences.

The ivWatch Model 400 is a device that assists medical professionals in monitoring patients for PIV infiltrations using an optical sensor. This device received FDA clearance and European Conformity Mark for use in the adult and pediatric age groups. ivWatch enhanced the Model 400 to support a new disposable electronic sensor (SmartTouch sensor). In this study, the SmartTouch Sensor will be tested in a neonatal population in a NICU setting.

* Most studies of infectious agents have focused on specific microbes, such as human papillomaviruses and cervical cancer, and the hepatitis B and C virus and liver cancer. The skin and many internal areas (including the mouth and the gastrointestinal tract) also contain large numbers of naturally occurring microbes, but these areas have not received as much study.
* Some of the infectious agents that naturally reside in the body may have an effect on health. The study of naturally occurring microbes in the human body is a new area of research, and much remains to be learned regarding the extent and pattern of their appearance and appropriate techniques for testing them.
* Researchers are interested in collecting human samples from areas known to contain naturally occurring microbes. These samples will provide baseline information for further studies.

Objectives:

- To collect a set of study samples from individuals who have applied to participate in a study assessing the relationship among the bacteria H. pylori, peptic ulcer disease, and gastric cancer.

Eligibility:

- Individuals between the ages of 21 and 65 who are participating in the clinical trial entitled A Phase III Randomized Trial of Three Antibiotic Regimens to Eradicate Helicobacter Pylori.

Design:

* Researchers will collect oral (saliva), colonic, and skin swab samples from study participants who tested positive for the presence of the H. pylori bacteria. These samples will be collected at the three study visits (enrollment, 6 weeks, and 1 year).

In such patients the treatment options are mainly palliative. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), transarterial chemotherapy (TAC) and various forms of oral chemotherapy are the only available options currently. Many patients have more advanced disease with the involvement of branches of portal vein. This further limits the therapeutic options. According to Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging, involvement of portal vein precludes any standard form of therapy. TAC and oral chemotherapy has been tried in this group of patients by few researchers. Which treatment (TAC or oral chemotherapy) would be better suitable for advanced stage (BCLC C) needs to be explored. However, there are no randomized controlled trials (RCT's) available.

TAC is the procedure for treating patients of HCC with portal vein invasion where only the chemotherapeutic drugs are injected into the feeding vessels of the tumor with no subsequent embolization of the feeding vessels.

NCT01640171,Anesthesia Preference for Intravitreal Injection: Topical or Subconjunctival,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01640171,,COMPLETED,"Since 2004, intravitreal injection of Avastin, Lucentis, and Macugen for wet age-related macular degeneration, retinal vein occlusion, and diabetic macular edema are being administered in the United States at increasing rates. A 2010 study showed that in Canada and the incidence of injections grew 8 fold from 2005 to 2007 to 25.9 injections per 100,000 citizens. (Campbell 2010) In 2009, in the United States, over 1 million intravitreal injections were administered to Medicare beneficiaries. (Wykoff 2011) In the year 2011, the four doctors in my retina group administered a total of 6,494 intravitreal injections; in 2010, we administered 5021 intravitreal injections.

Even though intravitreal injections are commonly administered, the optimal method of anesthetizing the eye prior to injection has yet to be determined. Some physicians use an anesthetic drop, some a soaked cotton pledget, some use an anesthetic gel and some use subconjunctival injected anesthetic.

In 2009, the last time the Procedures and Trends Survey (PAT) (Mittra 2009) conducted by the American Society of Retina Specialists (the largest retina society in the world) asked about anesthetic methods for administering intravitreal injections, the following response was given by the 433 respondents:

* Topical anesthetic drop: 21.48%
* Topical viscous anesthetic: 23.33%
* Topical anesthetic \& soaked cotton-tip or pledget: 29.79%
* Subconjunctival injection of anesthetic: 24.02%
* Other: 1.39%

The occurrence of respiratory failure is associated with morbidity and an increased mortality. To date, respiratory muscle weakness is predicted from the reduction of vital capacity, maximal inspiratory force, nocturnal symptoms and hypercapnia. Even taken together, the predictive value of these indices is low.

The investigators hypothesize that an endurance test of diaphragmatic work would be more sensitive to respiratory muscle involvement than maximal respiratory force.

Composed of 10 items, it allows to understand how the unpredictability, uncontrollability or excessiveness of life events are perceived as generators of stress by the individual. Each item is assigned a rating between 0 (""never"") and 4 (""very often""). To calculate the final score, it is necessary to reverse the rating of items referring to positive situations (items 4, 5, 7 and 8). Thus, a result between 0 and 40 points is obtained, with values between 0 and 13 being defined as low levels of stress, 14 to 26 medium levels and 27 to 40 high levels.

Respondents must rate each of the 15 items between 0 (""never/never"") to 6 (""always/everyday""). The final scores are interpreted in the 3 subscales, after the sum of their items, allowing the diagnosis of burnout syndrome when the respondent is simultaneously above the 66th percentile of the Emotional Exhaustion and Disbelief scores and below the 33rd percentile of the Professional Efficacy score, relative to the studied group., Change from Baseline at 2 months and 11 months|Quality of life change percieved in visual analogue scale, Visual Analogue Scale for Perceived Quality of Life (EQ-VAS: European Quality of Life - Visual Analogue Scale; EuroQol Group, 1990; Portuguese version by Ferreira, Ferreira \& Pereira, 2014) (Ferreira et al., 2013). It is an integral part of the EuroQoL-5Dimension scale (EQ-5D), which comprises two components: a descriptive system, subdivided into 5 dimensions, and a numerical system, achieved through a visual analogue scale - the EQ-VAS thermometer. This offers the possibility for the respondent to quantify their health status on a scale from 0 (""worst imaginable health status"") to 100 (""best imaginable health status""), at that moment.

Each subject must identify their level of agreement regarding the 24 items of the long version, on a scale from 0 (""almost never"") to 5 (""almost always""). Items 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10 , 12, 14, 18, 19, 22 and 23, corresponding to subscales with negative connotations (Indifference, Disconnected and Non-Involvement) must be recoded to access the total compassion score.

Considered the most used tool in the assessment of self-compassion, it seeks to measure how the individual behaves in difficult times, through emotional response (Warmness/Understanding vs. Self-criticism), cognitive understanding (Common Humanity vs. Isolation) and attention to one's own suffering. (Mindfulness vs. Overidentification). Each of the 26 items is assigned a rating from 0 (""almost never"") to 5 (""almost always""), and it is then possible to calculate the subtotal for each of the six subscales and the total score. For this, all items are summed after recoding items 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 16, 18, 20, 21, 24 and 25, with higher values reflecting higher levels of self-compassion., Change from Baseline at 2 months and 11 months|self-reflection and insight change, Self-Reflection and Insight Scale- New Adapted and Validated Self-Awareness Measure for Brazilian Adults (SRIS: Self-Reflection and Insight Scale; Grant et al., 2002 (Grant et al., 2002); Brazilian version by DaSilveira and DeCastro, 2012) (DaSilveira et al., 2012) ).

In addition to its aesthetic value, however, altered passive eruption could also affect gingival and periodontal health. In fact, in the case of plaque accumulation, the altered passive eruption (APE) is likely to be a predisposing factor for a more rapid progression of gingivitis with higher inflammation indexes (Angulated Bleeding Score - AngBs and Modified Gingival Index - mGI). Notwithstanding, even if gingivitis in patients with altered passive eruption is developed much more rapidly, thorough home oral hygiene and plaque control conduces to complete clinical recovery.

By using a 6-point Likert scale (0 = no limitation; 5 = severe limitation) , the total maximum scale is doubled and reported as a percentage of the patients perceived pain-related disability, with higher scores indicating greater disability. Because sex life could be an embarrassing issue in Chinese society, the investigators prefer to use modified or revised ODQ or MODQ,30,31 in which sex life is replaced by employment or homemaking.

Numerous factors have been suggested as contributing to or associated with the high prevalence of sleep disturbance in this population.

Increasing evidence suggests that cytokines are involved in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness and that the communication between the sleep and the immune system is bi-directional. Blood-dialyzer or peritoneum-dialysate interaction during dialysis therapy has the potential to activate mononuclear cells leading to production of inflammatory cytokines. These cytokines are believed to play a significant role in dialysis-associated morbidity and mortality. Nevertheless, a cytokine overproduction may alter sleep pattern in chronic dialyzed patients, thus explaining the presence of sleep disorders in these patients. In the other way, sleep loss may have effects on immune process and secretion of cytokines in chronic dialyzed patients.

NCT05030571,The Effects of Double Plasma Molecular Adsorption System in Acute on Chronic Liver Failure Patients,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05030571,,RECRUITING,"Acute liver failure patients posed high mortality rate despite receiving standard therapy. The severity and mortality even higher in patients with underlying liver disease. Acute liver failure cause hyperinflammatory response in early stage and immunoparalysis in later stage. The surge of proinflammatory cytokines leads to multiorgan failure and more liver injury. Subsequent immunoparalysis may lead to lethal secondary infections.

Liver support system had been used in acute and acute ontop chronic liver disease for last several decades. Double plasma molecular adsorption system (DPMAS) is one of the promising non-biological liver support system that have been extensively investigated in acute ontop chronic liver failure from hepatits B viral. DPMAS circuit consist of BS330 (bilirubin adsorber) and HA330 (Cytokines adsorber). Thus, DPMAS can also remove various cytokines. The effect of DPMAS on immune function in these patients has not been explored.

Recent randomized controlled trial by Srisawat et al. demonstrated improvement of mHLA-DR in septic shock patients who received polymyxin B extracorporeal therapy compare to control arm. Since liver failure show change of immunological profile resemble to sepsis. Investigators proposed that removal of toxic liver toxins and lethal cytokines by DPMAS will improve immunological profiles in acute ontop chronic liver failure patients.

To remain unconscious, the depth of sleep must be monitored. Various monitors have been developed, one of which is BIS (short for bispectral index). BIS monitors the level of sleep during anesthesia and improves patient recovery because the amount of sleep drugs can be fine-tuned to the individual. Patients who need a lot to stay asleep get more, and those who need less get less. As a result, patients tend to wake up faster with BIS monitoring as compared to standard practice not using BIS. Little is known about the long-term effects of BIS monitoring. This study investigates whether BIS monitoring during anesthesia improves long-term outcome, well after surgery is over. The hypothesis is that it does. Two groups of patients are compared: one in which BIS monitoring was used, and one in which it was not.

Recently renewed interest aroused for a tissue playing a possible role in both development and therapy for obesity: brown adipose tissue (BAT).

To define the relation between BAT and thyroid hormone, the investigators set up the following research protocol. In this protocol BAT activity will be determined in subjects that underwent thyroidectomy for well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma.

Objective: To study the effect of thyroid hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormone on brown adipose tissue activity.

Study design: Determine BAT activity after thyroidectomy in well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma patients.

Study population: Patients that underwent thyroidectomy for well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma, male and female, aged 18-65 years.

Intervention: FDG-PET-CT-imaging (\[18F\]fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission-tomography computed-tomography) of BAT activity will be performed under cold stimulation twice.

For patients clinically withdrawn from thyroid hormone suppletion, the first occasion will be in a hypothyroid state within 4-6 weeks after thyroidectomy and the second measurement will take place in a euthyroid state 4 months after the start of thyroid hormone treatment.

For patients receiving recombinant-thyroid-stimulating-hormone injections, the first occasion will be shortly after the injection in a state of high thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. The second measurement will be in a euthyroid state 4 months after the injection.

Main study parameters/endpoints: The main endpoint of this study is the effect of thyroid hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormone on BAT activity in kBq (kilobecquerel) and SUV (standard uptake value). Secondary endpoints are the effects of thyroid hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormone on energy metabolism, body core temperature, skin surface temperatures and skin perfusion.

However, lack of universal tracer availability and higher costs contributed to the failure of 18F-NaF to systematically supplant bone scintigraphy as a standard of care.

Recently, an isotope shortage crisis occurred and evidenced the need to have non-reactor-derived alternatives for many nuclear medicine procedures, including bone scintigraphy. Since 18F-NaF is cyclotron-produced, it could become a necessary alternative to bone scintigraphy in case of another worldwide isotope shortage.

Ideally, the inflammatory response is modulated leading to both adequate protection to invading pathogens as well as limitation of an exuberant immune response. In the last few years adenosine is proposed to have a central role in the modulation of inflammation. In unfavorable conditions such as hypoxia, ischemia or inflammation adenosine is quickly up-regulated; with concentrations up to tenfold in septic patients. Many animal studies have shown that adenosine is able to attenuate the inflammatory response and decrease mortality rates. Therefore, pharmacological elevation of the adenosine concentration is an potential target to attenuate inflammation and limit organ injury. Dipyridamole, an adenosine re-uptake inhibitor is able to increase the adenosine concentration and limit ischemia-reperfusion injury. In order to study the effects of dipyridamole on the inflammatory response we aim to use the so called human endotoxemia model.

Palmitic acid has known harmful effects on the body. Hence, eliminating palmitic acid from supplementation of POA might increase its benefits. This trial stems from the preclinical discoveries that POA acting as a fat hormone, has beneficial effects on the liver, muscle, vessels, and fat tissue. Supporting this, higher POA levels in humans have been shown to be correlated with a reduced risk of developing type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks. In animals, it has been observed that POA improves sugar metabolism in a number of mechanisms related to the liver and muscle.

NCT01105871,Subjective Analgesic Effects of Naloxone and Virtual Reality,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01105871,Narcan,UNKNOWN,"This study is designed to test a specific hypothesis exploring the neurophysiologic mechanism(s) that underlie the pain- relieving effects of immersive Virtual Reality (VR) as a non-pharmacologic pain management technique, using healthy volunteers experiencing carefully controlled thermal and/or electrical pain in the laboratory. Over the past decade, our research group has performed a series of NIH-funded investigations of VR analgesia - in both the clinical pain and laboratory pain settings - demonstrating its clinical efficacy and safety. In the current study we will test pharmacologic manipulation of VR analgesia (with the opioid analgesia antagonist naloxone). We anticipate that this theoretical work will provide a foundation for future clinical applications of immersive VR - whether used alone or in combination with other analgesic agents - and make immersive VR a more effective and more widely used analgesic tool for the treatment of clinical pain.

Our previous work with immersive VR indicates that its use during a painful event can reduce subjective pain reports during both acute clinical and laboratory pain by 20-50% \[1\]. Furthermore, we have shown that effective VR analgesia is associated with reduced pain-related brain activity that is quantitatively and qualitatively comparable to clinically relevant doses of systemic opioid analgesics \[2\]. The laboratory pain protocol proposed in the current application is identical to the UW HSD-approved protocol used in our previous studies (#25296 - ""Reducing Brief Thermal and Electrical Pain""). What is specifically different in the current protocol is the use of naloxone to determine whether VR analgesia operates through an endogenous opioid-dependent mechanism or not. The results of this study will not only suggest the mechanism of action of VR analgesia, but also allow us to more effectively apply immersive VR analgesia in the clinically pain setting through its thoughtful combination with well-established pharmacologic analgesic techniques, such as opioid analgesia administration.

The specific aim of this study and the hypothesis it tests are as follows: To determine the extent to which subjective analgesic effects of VR analgesia are inhibited by opioid receptor antagonism with naloxone. Hypothesis - VR analgesia will not be inhibited by systemic opioid receptor antagonism, suggesting that VR analgesia is not mediated by release of endogenous opiates and/or by activation of opioid-dependent descending central nervous system pathways.",NO,Pain,DRUG: naloxone|DRUG: Placebo,"Pain scoring from sessions where naloxone is given or placebo.Pain scoring is a questionnaire using analog scale (1-10)., Outcome measurements will be assessed when all research and analysis has been completed.

In patients with high blood pressure and high cholesterol, the blood vessels do not dilate properly. This study will investigate the effects of rosiglitazone-a drug used to improve the action of insulin in diabetic patients-on blood flow by examining its effects on endothelin (a substance that causes vessel constriction), and other substances produced by the vessel-lining cells.

Adults with blood pressure recordings of 140/90 mmHg or higher on at least three separate days or with a blood cholesterol level of at least 240 mg/dl may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history and physical examination, blood pressure recordings, blood and urine tests.

This ""crossover"" study involves two separate treatment periods; that is, participants will take either rosiglitazone or placebo (an inactive look-alike pill) once a day for 8 weeks, then no drug for 4 weeks, and then the alternative treatment for the next 8 weeks. Patients will continue to take their high blood pressure medicines during the first 6 weeks of each treatment period. They will stop the medication 2 weeks before the following procedures, which are done at the end of each 8-week treatment period:

Strain gauge plethysmography-A small catheter is placed through a needle into an artery at the bend of the arm for measuring blood pressure and drawing blood samples during the study. Pressure cuffs are placed on the wrist and upper arm, and a strain gauge (a rubber band device) is placed around the forearm to measure forearm blood flow. When the cuffs are inflated, blood flows into the arm, stretching the strain gauge at a rate proportional to the flow, and the measurement is recorded.

Small doses of four drugs-acetylcholine, bradykinin, sodium nitroprusside and BQ-123-are given through the catheter. Acetylcholine slows the heart rate. Bradykinin stimulates the release of a substance that causes blood vessels to dilate and can lower blood pressure. Sodium nitroprusside causes blood vessels to dilate and is used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. BQ-123 blocks the blood vessel-constricting activity of endothelin.

Brachial ultrasound reactivity study-A baseline ultrasound image (picture produced using sound waves) of the brachial artery (artery located at the bend of the arm) is taken and blood flow measurements are recorded. Then, a pressure cuff is placed around the upper forearm, inflated for 5 minutes to stop blood flow to the forearm, and then released. Images of the artery and flow measurements are repeated.

NCT02277171,Evaluation of Safety and Tolerability of Nitric Oxide Impregnated Urinary Catheters,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02277171,,COMPLETED,"According to the World Health Organization, hundreds of millions of patients are affected by health-care associated infections worldwide each year, resulting in prolonged hospital stays, long-term disabilities, deaths, and financial losses for health systems. The most common hospital-acquired infection is Urinary Tract Infection (UTI), accounting for almost 40% of all nosocomial infections. Most hospital-acquired UTIs are associated with catheterization. In fact, urinary catheter-related bacteriuria is the most common health care associated infection worldwide. Catheter-associated UTI (CAUTI) develops following adhesion of planktonic bacteria to the surface of the catheter and colonization, creating a persistent environment called a biofilm. The nature of biofilm structure together with the physiological attributes of biofilm organisms confers an inherent resistance to various antimicrobial agents such as antibiotics, disinfectants or germicides, augmenting the potential of these pathogens to cause infections in catheterized patients.

Nitric oxide (NO) is a naturally-produced gas molecule with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. NO is used in the clinics to treat pulmonary hypertension in neonates and adults. Studies have shown that low-dose NO is associated with prevention of biofilm formation, biofilm dispersal and elimination of bacteria. It is suggested that NO prevents bacteria attachment to catheter surfaces and inhibits biofilm formation in a mechanism involving reduction and modification of proteins that mediate cell-substrate and cell-cell interactions.

The investigators team, using a proprietary technology impregnate urinary catheters with NO (i.e. NO-impregnated catheters). These catheters release low concentration of NO following exposure to urine over a 14-day period. In vitro studies showed that NO-impregnated catheters prevent bacterial colonization and biofilm formation of Escherichia coli on exterior and luminal surfaces of the catheters. In addition, NO released from these catheters is able to eradicate up to 4log colony forming unit/ml of bacteria within the surrounding media. Moreover, NO-impregnated catheters exhibit superior performance compared to silver-coated catheters, and similar anti-infective properties compared to antibiotic-coated catheters.

NCT01553071,Phase I Trial of IV Fenretinide (4-HPR) Plus IV Safingol for Patients With Relapsed Malignancies,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01553071,,TERMINATED,"In preclinical studies, the anti-cancer efficacy of fenretinide, a synthetic retinoid that causes cytotoxicity by mechanisms which include increased intracellular dihydroceramides, has been shown to be enhanced by safingol, a stereochemical-variant dihydroceramide precursor. This phase I study represents the first clinical trial employing this promising combination. The drug administration schedule (fenretinide given on Days 1-5, safingol given on Days 1-2 of each 21-day cycle) reflects the in vitro observation that tumor cell exposure to safingol increased fenretinide efficacy both during and after safingol administration. The total dose of fenretinide, 4600 mg/m2 over 5 days, represents a 30% total dose reduction from the single agent MTD dose of 1280 mg/m2/day x 5 days determined on the PhI-42 study. This fenretinide dose is expected to produce plasma levels in the 30?s ?M. This dose reduction has been employed to reduce the potential for overlapping hepatic toxicities between these two agents.

The administration of a reduced fenretinide dose on Day 1 (600 mg/m2 on Day 1, escalated to 1000 mg/m2/day on Days 2-5) has been selected due to earlier observations that initial exposure to the soy bean oil vehicle in the fenretinide emulsion may induce endogenous lipases, thereby permitting tolerance of higher total doses fenretinide emulsion subsequently administered. The starting dose of safingol in this study, 210 mg/m2/day x 2 days (420 mg/m2 total), corresponds to 50% of the recommended Phase II safingol dose (bolus) determined in the Schwartz, et al, Phase I study of safingol plus cisplatin 60 mg/m2 (the MTD of single-agent, intravenous (emulsion) safingol was not reached in the Phase I safingol run-in monotherapy portion of this study), and was selected to provide an adequate safety margin against the potential for overlapping toxicities (such as hepatic transaminitis).

The study has been designed to optimize the safety of this novel combination. Treatment will be administered in the inpatient setting. Central venous access will be mandated to avoid the potential for hemolysis and thrombophlebitis associated with the preclinical peripheral administration of a previous safingol formulation in rats. To reduce the incidence of hypertriglyceridemia, a revised fenretinide delivery schedule will be employed. Patients will also be encouraged to maintain a low-fat diet during fenretinide administration. Serum triglycerides will be monitored every 12 hours. To monitor for cardiac toxicity, which was noted in canine studies at the highest dose of safingol plus fenretinide tested, serum troponin T levels will be monitored daily. To limit the potential for hepatotoxicity resulting from a possible drug interaction observed between intravenous fenretinide, ceftriaxone and acetaminophen in a pediatric patient, the concurrent administration of ceftriaxone, or acetaminophen, with the fenretinide emulsion infusion will be prohibited.",NO,Solid Tumor,DRUG: Fenretinide (4-HPR) plus Intravenous Safingol,"Determine the maximum tolerated dose of an intravenous safingol in combination with fenretinide, The primary outcome mesure of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of an intravenous (emulsion) safingol when administered as a continuous intravenous (c.i.v.) infusion for two days, once every 3 weeks, in combination with fenretinide (4-HPR) intravenous emulsion administered as a continuous intravenous infusion for five days, once every 3 weeks., approximately six months",,,South Plains Oncology Consortium,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE1,16,NETWORK,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,SPOC-2010-002,2016-11,2020-12,2020-12,2012-03-13,,2022-03-31,"University of Texas Southwestern, Dallas, Texas, 75390, United States|Joe Arrington Cancer Center/Covenant Children's Hospital, Lubbock, Texas, 79410, United States|University Medical Center, Lubbock, Texas, 79415, United States",

The authors concluded that Bevacizumab was well-tolerated and displayed promising anti-neoplastic activity in patients with endometrial cancer.The rationale for combining anti-angiogenic agents, including anti-VEGF antibodies, with cytotoxic chemotherapy stems from a number of preclinical studies showing additive and synergistic anti-tumour activity in a number of solid tumour types. By combining VEGF-targeting agents such as bevacizumab with conventional chemotherapies, it is hoped that these agents will act synergistically, thereby enhancing their anti-tumour efficacy and controlling disease progression.

It has recently become recommended by the UK National Health Service as a treatment for selected patients with type 2 diabetes. One drawback of VLCD however is the associated loss of skeletal muscle which affects some patients.

Semaglutide is a well-known medication for type 2 diabetes that also improves blood sugar control and facilitates weight loss. Recent research has shown that it may also stimulate muscle growth, meaning it could help to preserve muscle mass during weight loss. Therefore, this research study aims to see whether taking Semaglutide alongside the VLCD reduces the amount of muscle lost, and could improve the long-term outcomes of VLCD.

The study will take place in the Medical School building in the Royal Derby Hospital. Up to 45 participants will be recruited and allocated into one of 3 groups:

1. Semaglutide only
2. VLCD only
3. Combined Semaglutide plus VLCD The study is 12 weeks in duration and consists of four visits including two 6-hour visits, one 4-hour visit and one 30-minute visit. The first visit is a short Preliminary Visit where participants are asked to ingest stable isotope drinks for measurement of muscle growth rates and muscle mass.

Visits 1 \& 3 are identical and occur at the beginning and end of the 12-week intervention period, respectively.

These visits are expected to last up to 6 hours.

Visit 2 is a shorter visit mid-way through the 12 weeks, lasting approximately 4.5 hours. Participants will undergo another DXA scan and muscle biopsy in addition to having multiple blood tests taken over a 4-hour period to determine muscle protein breakdown rates.

The first item contains 11 questions related to physical functioning and are rated on a 4-point Likert-type scale, where 0 indicates 'always' and 3 indicates 'never'. The overall impact items are rated on a 0-7 scale for the number of days that the patient felt well and the number of days they were unable to work (including housework) because of fibromyalgia symptoms. The symptoms items are rated on visual analog scales (0-10 cm), with higher numbers indicated greater symptomatology. Final scores range from 0 (no impairment) to 10 (maximum impairment), where higher scores indicate worse outcome.

For this outcome, the change in total FIQ score from baseline is being reported. Negative values indicate improvement from baseline in impairment., Baseline up to Week 13 postdose|Number of Participants Classified As Responders at Week 13 Among Participants Receiving DS-5565, Pregabalin, or Placebo, The ADPS responder rate was defined a priori as the proportion of participants who met the clinically relevant reductions (ie, ≥30% and ≥50%) in ADPS at Week 13 (baseline observation carried forward) compared to Baseline., Week 13 postdose|Change From Baseline to Week 13 in Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20) General Fatigue Score Among Participants Receiving DS-5565, Pregabalin, or Placebo, MFI is a validated 20-item, self-reported instrument designed to measure fatigue in the following dimensions: general fatigue, physical fatigue, mental fatigue, reduced motivation, and reduced activity. The respondent is asked to mark an 'X' in 1 of 5 boxes arranged linearly where 1 is 'Yes, that is true' and 5 is 'No, that is not true.' Each subscale consists of 4 items, 2 indicative for fatigue and 2 contraindicative. For the indicative questions, a high score indicates a high fatigue level and low scores indicate a low fatigue levels. Conversely, for the contraindicative questions a high score indicates a low fatigue level and a low score indicates a high fatigue level. Overall, respondents are rated on a scale of 0 (no fatigue) to 7 (high fatigue).

For this outcome, the change from baseline in MFI-20 general fatigue subscale score is being reported. Negative values indicate an improvement in fatigue., Baseline up to Week 13 postdose|Change From Baseline to Week 13 in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) Measure Among Participants Receiving DS-5565, Pregabalin, or Placebo, The HADS questionnaire is a reliable, widely-used self-assessment scale to assess symptoms of anxiety and depression. The instrument consists of 7 questions related to anxiety and 7 related to depression, each rated on a 4-point scale (score of 0 to 3). Scores for anxiety and depression are independently summed to compute HADS-Anxiety and HADS-Depression subscale scores, with ranges from 0 to 21, where higher scores indicate greater severity., Baseline up to Week 13 postdose|Change From Baseline to Week 13 in Short Form 36 (SF-36) Measure Among Participants Receiving DS-5565, Pregabalin, or Placebo, The SF-36 is a generic health survey that asks 36 questions to measure functional health and well-being from the patient's point of view. The SF-36 provides scores for 8 health domains (physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health) as well as psychometrically-based physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores. Each scale is transformed into a 0-100 scale with each question carrying the same weight. The lower the score indicates more disability (ie, worse outcome)., Baseline up to Week 13 postdose|Change From Baseline to Week 13 in EuroQol Five Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ-5D) Measure Among Participants Receiving DS-5565, Pregabalin, or Placebo, The EQ-5D is an instrument that shows high construct validity and responsiveness in patients with chronic pain and has been used specifically in fibromyalgia. The EQ-5D includes a descriptive section with 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) each with a scale that ranges from 0 (no problems) to 5 (extreme problems). These 5 dimensions are combined into an overall health utilities index, and an numeric rating scale (100 mm visual analog scale) that measures perception of overall health, with 0 indicating worst health and 100 representing best imaginable health. A summary index with a maximum total score of 1 can be derived from these five dimensions by conversion with a table of scores. The maximum total score of 1 indicates the best health outcome.

For this outcome, the change from baseline in total EQ-5D score is being reported. Positive values indicate an improvement in health., Baseline up to Week 13 postdose|Change From Baseline to Week 13 in Average Daily Sleep Interference Score (ADSIS) Among Participants Receiving DS-5565, Pregabalin, or Placebo, Pain-associated sleep interference will be assessed using the Average Daily Sleep Interference Score that utilize electronic daily diaries with an 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS) for pain, ranging from 0 (pain does not interfere with sleep) to 10 (pain completely interferes with sleep, unable to sleep). Higher scores indicate worse outcomes., Baseline up to Week 13 postdose|Number of Participants Reporting Optimal Sleep at Week 13 on the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Sleep Scale Among Participants Receiving DS-5565, Pregabalin, or Placebo, The MOS Sleep Scale is a 12-item questionnaire from which the following subscales were derived: sleep disturbance (4 items), quantity of sleep/optimal sleep (1 item), snoring (1 item), awakening due to shortness of breath or due to headache (1 item), sleep adequacy (2 items), and somnolence (3 items). In addition, values for sleep disturbances index (9 items), optimal sleep scale (1 item), and sleep quantity scale (1 item) were determined. Most subscales range from 0 to 100, where higher scores indicate more of the concept begin measured (eg., higher sleep disturbance scores indicate greater sleep disturbances)., Week 13 postdose|Change From Baseline at Week 13 in the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPI-SF) Measure Among Participants Receiving DS-5565, Pregabalin, or Placebo, The BPI-SF measures pain severity and interference within the past 24 hours. Items are rated on an 11-point NRS from 0 to 10, where 0 indicates does not interfere and 10 indicates completely interferes. Severity score is the average of the responses to the 4 pain intensity items that assess the Worst/Least/Average pain in the last 24 hours and the Pain Right Now. The individual items being reported (using the same scale as noted above) are Severity, General Activity, Mood, Walking Ability, Normal Work, Relations With Other People, Sleep, and Enjoyment of Life. Percentage relief of treatment pain scale ranges from 100% (complete pain relief) to 0% (no pain relief) and higher percentages indicate better outcome. Interference % is the average of responses for General activity, Mood, Walking ability, Normal work, Relations with other people, Sleep, Enjoyment of life where 0% (no interference) to 100% (completely interferes) and negative (ie. lower) percentages indicate better outcomes., Baseline up to Week 13 postdose|Proportion of Days a Rescue Medication Was Used Among Participants Receiving

Recent works suggest that the Forced Oscillation Technique (FOT) may help to improve our understanding of the changes in lung mechanics, as well as in the detection of these changes.

Objectives: Analyze the effects of airway obstruction in silicosis on the respiratory impedance and evaluated the diagnostic use of the FOT in these patients. For this, the investigators used spirometry to classify airway obstruction, which resulted in four categories: control, patients with normal exam, mild obstruction, and moderate-to-severe obstruction. Resistive data were interpreted using the zero-intercept resistance (R0), the resistance at 4 Hz (Rrs4) and the mean resistance (Rm). The investigators also analyzed the mean reactance (Xm) and the dynamic compliance (Crs,dyn). The total mechanical load was evaluated using the absolute value of the respiratory impedance (Z4Hz).

Our purpose was to determine the long term clinical and radiographic outcomes of these patients.

Methods: Forty patients (43 hips) who had undergone VDRO for LCPD who participated in a long term follow-up study a decade ago were approached for the present study.

All patients were treated in our institution during 1959 to 1983 with proximal VDRO.

The patients were invited to for a medical interview and a physical examination. They were also asked to fill out questionnaires and to provide or undergo a standing anteroposterior (AP) pelvic and a lateral hip radiographs during the visit.

Patients were asked to self-grade their hip pain as none, mild, moderate or severe and to grade their back pain using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) between 0-10. Details regarding daily function, physical activity, work status and family history were obtained. All participants completed the Harris Hip Score (HHS) with a maximum score of 100 and the Short Form-36 which is composed of 8 sections and has a maximum score of 100.

NCT02079571,"Investigation of Pulse Waves, Channel Entries, and Food Attributes in Healthy Subjects With Different Constitutions",https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02079571,,UNKNOWN,"In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), hot- and cold-attribute of food ingredients are a major part of dietary therapy. ""Eight Principles"" including cold/hot, repletion/vacuity, yin/yang and exterior/interior are used for diagnose by Chinese medical doctors. From the perspective of TCM, all constitutions, diseases, herbal medicine and foods can be divided into these two major categories, i.e., cold and hot. Therefore, dietary therapy claims that the attributes of foods should be used to oppose our constitutions in order to harmonize organ functions and maintain human vitality. The true benefit of dietary therapy is considered to be the reestablishment of a harmonious balance between cold and hot, or repletion and vacuity, within the human body.

Previous studies reported that the capillary red blood cell (RBC) velocity in nail fold microcirculation (NFM) of the subjects with hot constitution accelerated significantly after taking the hot attribute aged ginger tea, which might be the result of elevated vagal activity leading to arteriole dilation in these subjects. In contrast, in subjects with cold constitution, capillary RBC velocity decelerated significantly and skin temperature decreased markedly after taking the cold-attribute coconut water, which might have been induced by sympathetic nerve activation causing the arteriole to be constricted. As a result, the use of capillary RBC velocity of NFM measured by laser Doppler anemometer may be a promising way to classify attributes of food ingredients commonly used in Chinese medicine dietary therapy in accordance with different personal constitutions.

Accordingly, it will be a worthwhile task to establish a modern scientific methodology to define the attributes of food ingredients. The aim of this project is to investigate the relationship between food attributes and the physiological signals produced in healthy young subjects with different constitutions. In the first year of this project, investigators are starting to determine the pulse waves produced in healthy subjects with different constitutions by a Smart Pulse Wave Health Evaluation System (S-PULSE). Then, investigators will investigate the relationship between food attributes, channel entries and the physiological signals.

NCT03158571,Chilean Gastric Cancer Task Force (FORCE 1),https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03158571,FORCE-1,COMPLETED,"Background. Gastric cancer (GC) is the world's second leading cause of neoplastic mortality. Genetic alterations, response to treatments and mortality rates are highly heterogeneous across different regions. In Chile, GC is the leading cause of cancer death, affecting 20 per 100,000 people and \>3,000 deaths/year. Clinical outcomes and response to ""one size fits all"" therapies are highly heterogeneous and thus a better stratification of patients may aid cancer treatment and response.

Study design/methods. The Gastric Cancer Task Force (GCTF) is a Chilean collaborative, non-interventional retrospective study that seeks to stratify gastric adenocarcinomas (GACs) using retrospect clinical outcomes and genomic, epigenomic and protein alterations in a cohort of 200 patients. Tumor samples from the pathology department and the Cancer Center at UC Christus healthcare network at Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile will be analyzed using a panel of 143 known cancer genes (Oncomine Comprehensive Assay) at the Center of Excellence of Precision Medicine (CEMP) in Santiago, Chile. Additionally, gene promoter methylation will be performed and selected clinically relevant proteins (e.g. PD-L1, Erb-2, VEGFR2 among others) will be assessed by Tissue Microarray, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) status will also be assessed. Observations will be correlated to 120 clinical parameters, including general patient information, cancer history, laboratory studies, comorbidity index, chemotherapy, targeted therapies, efficacy and follow-up.

Patients are randomized in two groups: group A, patients undergoing to lung ultrasound and physical examination; and group B, patients undergoing to physical examination only. Patients are evaluated at baseline and after three months with medical history, Quality of Life test, physical examination, blood sample for hematochemical (creatinine, electrolytes, BNP/NTpro-BNP).

The diuretic therapy is then optimized according to the presence and severity of B-lines in group A and physical examination in group B.

Only patients enrolled in group A undergo to a lung ultrasound examination to assess the extent of pulmonary congestion, through its evidence of B-lines. B-lines originate from the contrast between air-filled structures and water-thickened pulmonary interlobular septa. This leads to linear echogenic vertical artefacts that spread from the pleural layers downwards in the screen. The ultrasound examination is performed with a handheld echocardiography device. The physician carries out a scan of the pulmonary fields, from basal towards mid and apical fields, through the midaxillary line while the patient lies supine. The quantification of B-lines is performed according to their extent over the lung fields. All the information are recorded in dedicated forms.

The results are evaluated according to the following criteria. The primary end-point is a significant reduction of hospitalizations for acute decompensated HF in group A during the follow-up period.

This study is an exploratory single-arm study. The specific treatment regimen is as follows: Non-squamous NSCLC: Sintilimab (200 mg) plus Bevacizumab (7.5mg/kg) is started on the first day of each treatment cycle and administered every three weeks. Nedaplatin (80-100 mg/m2) (d2) +pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 (d2) Q3W is administered in this regimen for 4 cycles followed by sintilimab plus bevacizumab until disease progression or intolerable toxicity.

Patients are assessed for measurable disease at baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks after starting treatment, and every 9 weeks thereafter according to RECIST 1.1 criteria during the treatment period until disease progression or intolerable toxicity withdrawal. Following discontinuation of treatment, subjects are followed for survival status every 3 months until death. Subject safety was assessed during treatment according to NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 criteria. Subjects who experience an AE should be followed until the AE returns to baseline. The primary endpoints is Progression-free survival (PFS) . Secondary endpoints include objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS) and safety (NCI CTCAE v 4.0). Statistical methods: The PFS curve was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method for the largest population to be analyzed. The confidence interval method was used as the criterion for the main analysis. OS was calculated in the same way as the secondary endpoint.

NCT02690571,Pulmonary Effects of 100% Biodiesel Exhaust,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02690571,BD100Broncho,COMPLETED,"Air pollution is a global environmental and health concern, contributing to onset and deterioration of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. As climate change and dependence on diminishing fossil fuel supplies have taken center stage in political and scientific debates, renewable carbon-neutral fuels like biodiesel receive increasing attention. The most common biodiesel within the European Union, rapeseed oil methyl ester (RME) is perceived to be a ""green fuel"", as it is sustainable and of biological origin, and therefore is often predicted to be less harmful to human health. Whilst replacing petrodiesel with biodiesel may have advantageous ecological impacts, consequences to respiratory health remained largely unexplored.

In recent years, tens of thousands of LVADs have been implanted worldwide, with nearly 1,000 at the Texas Heart Institute (THI). Despite the benefits from LVAD therapy, one major weakness is the high frequency of late strokes, reported up to 19%. CF LVADs minimize or remove the pulsatility within the blood system, introducing a new and incompletely understood physiology.

Increased sympathetic (""fight or flight"" nervous system) tone secondary to lack of pulse in the blood system can cause high blood pressure, with subsequent hemorrhaging strokes (bleeding into the brain) are one possible explanation for this high adverse event rate in CF LVAD patients. A simple intervention to decrease the increased sympathetic tone is called ""ischemic conditioning""; a sphygmomanometer (blood pressure cuff) is placed on the patient's arm to compress a major artery (ischemia) with subsequent release of the cuff (reperfusion) for set periods of time. This has been shown to reduce blood pressure and major adverse cardiovascular events in other patient populations.

Improper posture can cause pain throughout the length of the spine from the neck to the pelvis. Modern sedentary style of living is one of the main reasons for postural abnormalities evident in modern society. The prolonged sitting hours required in most of the jobs, and educational setups can affect flexibility of soft tissues, especially two joint muscles. Bad posture while standing or walking, if left uncorrected, can worsen over time and lead to pain and dysfunction. Hamstring is a key component of flexibility in the human body and it is more prone to get tightened. Many reasons can lead to the development of hamstring tightness such as genetic predisposition, injury to muscle, and adaptive shortening due to some chronic condition. Short hamstring muscles, because of their attachments to the posterior leg and to the ischial tuberosity, may limit hip flexion ROM and induces posterior pelvic tilt and decreased lumbar lordosis, which can result in LBP The purpose of this study will be to find out the effects of stretching with and without pressure biofeedback unit (PBU) on hamstring muscle flexibility in patients with postural syndrome. The active knee extension (AKE) test will be used to determine the length of the hamstring muscles using a goniometer.

NCT01066871,Sprifermin (AS902330) in Cartilage Injury Repair (CIR),https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01066871,,TERMINATED,"Several people all over the world suffer from cartilage injuries in the knee. Symptoms include pain, joint swelling, and loss of function. Without repair, cartilage injury may ultimately lead to osteoarthritis (OA). Natural healing is poor, and to date treatment is available only for deep cartilage defects involving also the underlying bone. A promising candidate for drug treatment of cartilage injury is sprifermin (AS902330), a recombinant form of the human fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 18.

So far, the drug has been used in subjects with different stages of knee OA in two ongoing studies without emerging safety issues following single and multiple intra-articular injections of ascending doses. However, OA represents late-stage cartilage injury, where repair might be difficult due to diffuse damage, reduced responsiveness of the cartilage, and/or the involvement of other joint structures.

This clinical trial is meant to provide the proof of concept and to identify an efficacious dose of sprifermin (AS902330) for the treatment of adult subjects with acute cartilage injuries of the knee. The first subject for this trial was treated on the 19th of April 2010.",YES,Isolated Cartilage Injury of the Knee,DRUG: Sprifermin (AS902330) 10 mcg|DRUG: Sprifermin (AS902330) 30 mcg|DRUG: Sprifermin (AS902330) 100 mcg|OTHER: Placebo,"Percent Change From Baseline in Cartilage Defect Volume at Month 12, Percent change in cartilage defect volume was calculated based on central magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): (volume at Month 12 minus volume at baseline)\*100/volume at baseline., Baseline, Month 12","Percent Change From Baseline in Cartilage Defect Volume and Cartilage Defect Thickness in the Target Knee at Months 3 and 6, Percent change in cartilage defect volume and cartilage defect thickness at Months 3 and 6 based on central MRI was calculated as: (\[volume or thickness at Months 3 and 6 minus volume or thickness at baseline, respectively\]\*100)/volume or thickness at baseline., Baseline, Months 3 and 6|Change From Baseline in Cartilage Defect Volume in the Target Knee at Months 3, 6 and 12, The change in cartilage defect volume at Months 3, 6 and 12 based on central MRI was calculated as volume at Months 3, 6 and 12 minus volume at baseline, respectively., Baseline, Months 3, 6 and 12|Change From Baseline in Cartilage Defect Thickness in the Target Knee at Months 3, 6 and 12, The change in cartilage defect thickness at Months 3, 6 and 12 based on central MRI was calculated as thickness at Months 3, 6 and 12 minus thickness at baseline, respectively., Baseline, Months 3, 6 and 12|Number of Participants With Response to Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) Sub-scales, MOCART scoring system (comprising 9 variables) was used to describe the morphology \& signal intensity of the repair tissue following MRI -degree of defect repair \[DDR\] score 0 (subchondral bone exposed) to 20 (complete repair); integration to the border zone \[IBZ\] score 0 (\> 50% of length of repair tissue) to 15 (complete integration to border zone);surface of repair tissue \[SRT\] score 0 (\>50% surface repair tissue/total degradation) to 10(surface intact);structure of repair tissue \[StRT\] score 0(inhomogenous/cleft formation) to 5 (homogenous);signal intensity \[T2\] Mapping Sequence \[T2MS\] and Hi-Res Sagittal Pharmacodynamic Sequence \[Hi-Res SPS\] score 0 (marked hyper intense for T2MS and hypo intense for Hi-Res SPS) to 15 (iso intense); subchondral lamina,subchondral bone score 0 (not impact) to 5 (intact);adhesions \& effusion score 0 (yes) and 5 (no).

The severity of PTSD symptoms is positively correlated with amygdala activation. More severe PTSD symptoms following exposure to stressful events, are associated with amygdala hyper-responsivity prior to exposure. A possible intervention for PTSD is Neurofeedback (NF) - a treatment method based on learned self-modulation of neural activity in response to feedback of neural signal. Previous work in our lab established a NF training procedure that utilizes the temporal abilities of EEG with the spatial advantages of fMRI. Further work based on this method using the amygdala BOLD signal (EEG-finger-print, EFP) has demonstrated a potential for improving the ability to self-regulate amygdala activity and to improve emotional regulation in a healthy population.

NCT02075671,Photodynamic Therapy for Papulopustular Rosacea,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02075671,,COMPLETED,"Rosacea is a chronic inflammatory disorder that is characterized by severe flushing (transient erythema), non-transient erythema, papules, pustules, and telangiectasia. Topical therapy is not always effective in treating symptoms of rosacea. Furthermore, rapid recurrence is common following the use of systemic antibiotics, resulting in the chronic use of these medications to control the disease. Although the exact pathogenesis of rosacea is unknown, treatment for this condition has been investigated based on its similarity to acne and photodamaged skin. Case reports have shown promising results in rosacea patients treated with methyl aminolevulinate photodynamic therapy (MAL - PDT). Other than a case report which observed significant improvement of papules, pustules, erythema, and flushing following 5 - aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy (ALA-PDT) treatment of a patient with rosacea, the role of ALA-PDT in the treatment of rosacea has not been reported.

We have designed a pilot study investigating the efficacy of ALA-PDT in treating papulopustular rosacea. The objectives of the study are as follows:

Primary objective:

1. To evaluate improvement of the inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, nodules), erythema, and telangiectasia of rosacea as assessed by the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA).
2. To evaluate improvement of the inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, nodules) of rosacea as assessed by the Inflammatory Lesion Investigator's Global Assessment (ILIGA).

   Secondary objectives:
3. To evaluate improvement of rosacea associated erythema as assessed by the Clinical Erythema Assessment (CEA) scale.
4. To evaluate improvement of the inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, nodules) of rosacea as measured by a difference in inflammatory lesion count.

NCT04281771,Assessment of Paravalvular Leak After TAVI by Hemodynamic Measurements and Cardiac MRI,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04281771,APPOSE,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Rationale: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has become the standard therapy for elderly patients with high surgical risks. Paravalvular leakage after TAVI is relatively common and there is conflicting evidence regarding the clinical impact of mild paravalvular leakage in self-expanding devices. Prospective data for self-expanding devices are required to compare the extent of paravalvular leakage as a result of device design. Grading paravalvular leakage after TAVI is difficult. Echocardiography and angiography systematically underestimate paravalvular leakage (PVL) as compared to cardiac MRI. Hemodynamic measurements are used to aid decision making directly after TAVI implantation. Prospective data comparing hemodynamic measurements with cardiac MRI are needed to design an optimal strategy to grade paravalvular leakage peri-operatively in order to optimize TAVI outcomes.

Objective: To assess procedural hemodynamic measurements in patients with paravalvular regurgitation quantified by means of cardiac MRI (CMR) and to analyse its association with impaired clinical outcome during 5-year follow-up.

Study design: This is a prospective, single center clinical trial. Patients will receive a TAVI. After implantation different hemodynamic indices of paravalvular leakage will be assessed. At 1 month a cardiac MRI will be performed to quantify the amount of paravalvular leakage. Standardized clinical follow-up will take place at discharge, 30 days, 3 months and yearly up to 5 years.

Study population: Approximately 80 patients with severe symptomatic aortic valve stenosis with an indication for TAVI will be included.

Intervention: Patients will undergo cardiac MRI on top of standard clinical care within 30 days after TAVI.

Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary endpoint is defined as paravalvular leakage regurgitation fraction as measured by cardiac MRI. The secondary endpoint will comprise a composite of device success, early safety and clinical efficacy as defined by the Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 (VARC-2)(1) and will comprise death, vascular complications, stroke/ Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA), life threatening bleeding requiring transfusion, and acute kidney injury requiring dialysis.",NO,Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement|Hemodynamic Monitoring|Aortic Valve Insufficiency|Aortic Valve Stenosis,PROCEDURE: cardiac MRI,"The PVL regurgitation fraction, as measured by cardiac MRI, within 30 days after TAVI","Hemodynamic measurement diastolic delta, the gradient between diastolic aortic pressure and LVEDP, During TAVI|Hemodynamic measurement Aortic regurgitation index, ratio of the diastolic delta to systolic aortic pressure, During TAVI|Device succes, VARC-2 definition, Up to 1 year|Vascular complications, VARC-2 definition, Up to 1 year|Bleeding, VARC-2 definition, Up to 1 year|Stroke/ TIA, VARC-2 definition, Up to 1 year|Permanent pacemaker implantation, VARC-2 definition, Up to 1 year|Kidney injury, VARC-2 definition, Up to 1 year|Death, VARC-2 definition, Up to 5 year",,Radboud University Medical Center,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,92,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: DIAGNOSTIC,NL70413.091.19,2019-09-17,2021-11-27,2026-10-28,2020-02-24,,2022-04-29,"Radboudumc, Nijmegen, 6525 GA, Netherlands",

The conditions in those situations are different to the usual usage of telemedicine in context of emergency medical services (EMS) like the ""Telenotarzt"" in Aachen. The medical personnel who are performing the medical treatment in ambulance stations or civil defense situations are most volunteers and are ordinarily not as experienced and educated as professional medical personnel in EMS. In case of civil defense situations, the personnel also must deal with shortage in material which we are not going to simulate in our study.

The study will be realized at each one ambulance station at four large-scale events. Every time there will be a telemedicine workspace with an EMS-physician educated in telemedicine who can be contacted by briefed and equipped medical personnel according to the ""TeleSAN""-standard. The emergency personnel start the patient's treatment according to their known standards and decide on their own whether they want to contact the tele-EMS-physician or not.

Before starting the tele-consultation, every patient must declare his consent to the tele-consultation, otherwise tele-consultation cannot be realized, and the patient needs to be treated according to common standards.

Due to spatial proximity of the telemedicine workspace and the ambulance station, the tele-EMS-physician can also work as an EMS-physician in the ambulance station if necessary.

Otago Exercise Program (OEP) was a tailor-made home-based fall prevention program of community-dwelling elderlies. It comprises of 3 main components: 5 lower limb strengthening, 12 balance retraining and walking exercises. Regarding on its effectiveness, multiple studies revealed that OEP and modified version of OEP (mOEP) brought significant improvements on perceived, static and dynamic balance, lower limb strength, quality of life and functional capacity of healthy elderlies and those with various health conditions such as chronic illnesses, osteoarthritis, stroke and hemiplegia.

The delivery method of OEP and mOEP has been limited to have elderlies following the instructions and illustrations of a printed booklet. Currently, there are only two proposed effective forms of mOEP: video-instructed and Exergames. Our study attempts to establish a new home-based exercise option incorporating mOEP with video, music and lyrics. It helps to increase the exercise motivation of elderlies, hence their physical performance.",NO,Healthy Aging|Fall,OTHER: Modified Otago Exercise Program with music|OTHER: Modified Otago Exercise Program,"Falls Efficacy Scale International (FES-I), The Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) is a modified version of the FES, based on the perceptive feeling on fall risks of the participants.

NCT02793271,Reducing Stigma Among Healthcare Providers to Improve Mental Health Services,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02793271,RESHAPE-mh,COMPLETED,"A growing number of trials have demonstrated treatment effectiveness for people with mental illness (PWMI) by non-specialist providers, such as primary care and community health workers, in low-resource settings. A barrier to scaling up these evidence-based practices is the limited uptake from trainings into service provision and lack of fidelity to evidence-based practices among non-specialists. This arises, in part, from stigma among non-specialists against PWMI. Therefore, interventions are needed to address attitudes among non-specialists. To address this gap, REducing Stigma among HeAlthcare Providers to improvE Mental Health services (RESHAPE-mh), is an intervention for non-specialists in which social contact with PWMI is added to training and supervision programs. A pilot cluster randomized control trial will address primary objectives including trainees' perspectives on perceived acceptability of PWMI's participation in training and supervision, intervention fidelity and contagion, assessment of randomization, and feasibility and psychometric properties of outcome measures in a cluster design. Secondary objectives are change in provider and patient outcomes. The control condition is existing mental health training and supervision for non-specialists delivered through the Programme for Improving Mental Healthcare (PRIME), which includes the mental health Global Action Programme (mhGAP) and psychosocial treatments. The intervention condition will incorporate social contact with PWMI into existing PRIME training and supervision. Participants in the pilot will be the direct beneficiaries of training and supervision (i.e., primary care workers) and indirect beneficiaries (i.e., their patients). Primary care workers' outcomes include knowledge (mhGAP knowledge scale), explicit attitudes (mhGAP attitudes and social distance scales), implicit attitudes (Implicit Association Test), and clinical competence (Enhancing Assessment of Common Therapeutic factors, ENACT) to be assessed pre-training, post-training, and at 4-month follow-up. Patient outcomes include functioning, stigma experiences in accessing care, and depression/alcohol use symptoms to be assessed at initiation of mental health care and 6 months later.

One of the biggest threats to cessation is a lapse (i.e., any cigarette use during a quit attempt). Thus, characterizing why lapses occur is essential to understanding and preventing smoking relapse. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a promising method for characterizing the psychological processes that lead to smoking lapses because it provides a way to measures patterns of brain activity thought to reflect relevant mental processes as they change over time. However, methodological issues have hindered the ability to capitalize on this potential and prevented an understanding of how brain activity and corresponding psychological processes unfold in the critical moments that immediately precede a smoking lapse. The proposed project will address this knowledge gap using a novel fMRI paradigm adapted from a well-validated behavioral lapse task.

NCT05466071,Safety and Efficacy of TAF to Prevent MTCT of HBV in Middle/Late Pregnancies With High HBV DNA Load,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05466071,,RECRUITING,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is still a major public health problem worldwide. There are 260 million people with chronic HBV infection in the world, and 890,000 people die of HBV-related diseases annually. Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) is still the main transmission route of HBV in high-endemic areas, such as China, sub-Saharan Africa, etc. Fortunately, the morbidity of HBV infection is gradually decreased in China, because newborns are administrated with the combined immunization of hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) widely. However, some infants born of mothers with high HBV DNA load (≥2×10\^5 IU/ml) are still infected with HBV even if these infants receive the combined immunization on time. Therefore, guidelines including American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and European Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (EASL) recommend that pregnant women with high HBV DNA load should take anti-hepatitis B viral drugs (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or terbivudine) to reduce MTCT of HBV from gestation 24-28 weeks.

Although tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) has been classified as B drug for pregnancy by Food and Drug Administration (FDA), some side effects of TDF are reported. For example, neutropenia and the decrease of bone mineral density are found in early age infants who are ever exposed to TDF during their fetal life.

Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), a new prodrug of tenofovir (TFV), has a higher antiviral potency, a higher peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) intracellular tenofovir diphosphate (TFVpp) level and a lower plasma TFV concentration. As the successor of TDF, the dose of TAF that is took orally every day is approximately 1/10 of TDF. TAF has a much lower risk of kidney toxicity and has almost no effect on the bone mineral density. TAF has been approved and recommended as the first-line drug to treat patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) by AASLD, EASL, etc. However, there are relatively few data of TAF on pregnancies with high HBV DNA load. It is urgently to clarify the safety and efficacy of TAF on interrupting MTCT of HBV in pregnancies with high HBV DNA load.

In the present study, the investigators enroll middle/late pregnancies with high HBV DNA load(≥2×10\^5 IU/ml). The participants are randomly divided into two groups. Then the participants are treated with TAF or TDF respectively. All enrolled participants are followed-up for 2 years. Objectives of the present study are as follows:

A. To clarify safety and efficacy of TAF on interrupting MTCT of HBV in middle/late pregnancies with high HBV DNA load.

B. To clarify effects of TAF on obstetric complications in middle/late pregnancies with CHB.

C. To clarify effects of TAF on birth defects of infants born in mothers with CHB.

D. To clarify the change of virology and biochemistry indexes in women with CHB during pregnancy and postpartum.

E. To clarify effects of TAF treatment on participants.

F. To clarify growth parameters of the infants exposed to TAF during their fetal life.

G. To clarify the pharmacokinetics of TAF in pregnant populations.",NO,Chronic Hepatitis b|Pregnancy Related,,"The proportion of interrupting MTCT, The proportion of HBV infection in the infants at 1 year of age.

These factors include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes (high blood sugar), tobacco smoking, unhealthy diet, obesity, physical inactivity and high alcohol consumption. Such factors are very common and not very well controlled and so individuals who have any of these factors would be at risk of having cardiovascular disease. As such controlling these factors will reduce the risk of having cardiovascular disease and improve the individuals' quality of life. Pharmacists frequently work with patients and their family doctor to provide cardiovascular care. Having a pharmacist involved in cardiovascular care may help patients with cardiovascular disease or at risk of having the disease because they are more accessible and may have more opportunities to educate people about cardiovascular medications. This might lead to better prevention and control of cardiovascular disease.

Purpose:

The research study will assess if a community pharmacy cardiovascular risk reduction intervention can help reduce cardiovascular risk.

Procedure:

If the individual has an elevated blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, waist circumference or body weight or is physically inactive, have an unhealthy diet, a smoker or taking medications for any of the previously mentioned conditions, the pharmacist will assess the cardiovascular disease risk \[risk of having a cardiovascular event (e.g. heart attack or a stroke)\] using a computer program. If the individual is at high risk s/he will be asked to take part in the study.

If the individual agrees to take part in the study s/he will be randomly assigned to either the Usual Care Group or the Advanced Care Group. All participants have an equal chance of being assigned to either group. If assigned to the Usual Care Group, the individual will receive the care and services that would normally be provided by the pharmacist. At 3 months, the pharmacist will see the individual who will be offered the Advanced Care at that time.

If assigned to the to Advanced Care Group, the individual will be asked to meet with the pharmacist every 3-4 weeks over a 3 month period. During these meetings, the pharmacist will conduct an assessment that may include blood pressure, waist circumference, height and weight measurements and talk to the individual about their cardiovascular risk and medications. The individual and the pharmacist will come up with a plan for how to try to lower his/her cardiovascular risk. The pharmacist will discuss this plan with their family doctor. The individual will be asked to conduct some laboratory tests before the 3 months visit; these tests may include HbA1c (a blood test to measure blood sugar control over the last 3 months) and cholesterol to assess the effect of the intervention on cardiovascular risk.",NO,Diabetes|Chronic Kidney Disease|Established Atherosclerotic Vascular Disease|Framingham Risk Score More Than 20 Percent,OTHER: Advanced Care,"The difference in change in estimated cardiovascular risk between advanced care and usual care groups, The difference in change in estimated cardiovascular risk between advanced care and usual care groups, 3 months","Difference in change in individual cardiovascular risk factors between advanced care and usual care groups, Difference in change in individual cardiovascular risk factors between advanced care and usual care groups, including LDL-cholesterol, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, HbA1c, lifestyle (diet and exercise) and smoking cessation., 3 months|Achievement of individual and the ""triple target"", Achievement of individual and the ""triple target"" of LDL-cholesterol ≤ 2.0 mmol/L, blood pressure control BP \<140/90 mmHg (\<130/80 in those with diabetes) and glycemic control (HbA1c ≤ 7.0) in advanced care compared to usual care group patients in those with diabetes., 3 months",,University of Alberta,Alberta Health & Wellness|Alberta Health services|Merck Frosst Canada Ltd.,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,723,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: SINGLE (PARTICIPANT)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,pro00041644,2014-01,2015-09,2015-12,2013-11-08,,2017-10-30,"EPICORE Centre, Edmonton, Alberta, T6G 2M8, Canada",

NCT03789071,Ultrasound to Predict Difficult Airway,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03789071,,RECRUITING,"Upper airway ultrasound is a valuable, non-invasive, simple, and portable point of care tool for evaluation of the airway, even in the presence of anatomic distortion caused by pathology or trauma. The ultrasound technology is being increasingly adopted in modern anesthesiology practice. As early as in 1984, some authors have recommended its use to guide venous cannulation, because it shortens procedural times, reduces the number of failed puncture attempts, and minimizes complications. On the other hand, ultrasound-guided techniques are considered the gold standard for peripheral nerve blocks.

As ultrasound becomes more widespread, it is important to for anesthesiologists to be aware of the expanding applications of this technology. Current and potential future applications of ultrasound in anesthesiology are wide and include regional anesthesia, neuraxial and chronic pain procedures, vascular access, airway assessment, lung ultrasound, ultrasound neuro-monitoring, gastric ultrasound, focused transthoracic echography, trans-esophageal echocardiography and vascular Doppler flow assessment. The major disadvantage is inter-observer variability, and the fact that it requires is a unique skill that requires continuing training and experience to master the technology. In order to be successful with this technique, it is important to develop a thorough understanding of the sonoanatomy. The normal or abnormal structures need to be imaged and interpreted before any intervention.

Airway management is one of the most important tasks for anesthesiologists. Access to the airway should be safe, fast and efficient. Appropriate planning is crucial to avoid morbidity and mortality when difficulty is anticipated. Inability to maintain airway ventilation is a life-threatening situation that may warrant emergent surgical access to prevent devastating consequences. A thorough assessment of the airway is recommended to predict difficulty. Multiple clinical predictors have been used in clinical practice; however, most of them are associated with low predictive values. In consequence, a comprehensive airway examination that incorporates both quantitative and qualitative tests increases the probability of predicting difficult intubation. Regardless of the method of airway evaluation, it is important to acknowledge that clinical airway assessment is not fully accurate and can produce both false-negative and false-positive results.

There is a growing academic interest in the ability of ultrasound to determine airway size to estimate appropriate endotracheal tube size. Ultrasound enables us to identify important sonoanatomy of the upper airway including thyroid cartilage, epiglottis, cricoid cartilage, cricothyroid membrane, tracheal cartilages, and esophagus. Transverse and parasagittal views can help diagnose supraglottic, glottic and infraglottic airway conditions and aid the anesthesiologist in airway management. Ultrasonography has brought a paradigm shift in the practice of airway management.

NCT02425371,Optimized Management of Comorbidity in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction in the Elderly (>60 Years),https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02425371,OPTIMIZE-HFPEF,UNKNOWN,"Growing recognition of the importance of co-morbidities in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFPEF) has led to the realization that rather than being a distinct disease entity, HFPEF may represent a spectrum of co-morbidities in elderly breathless patients. Accordingly, progress in managing HFPEF in the elderly requires improved understanding of HFPEF pathogenesis with a focus on the impact of co-morbidities. However, the available evidence is insufficient to determine the true prevalence and severity of co-morbidities as well as their impact on both diagnosis and treatment in HFPEF. Therefore there are widespread diagnostic uncertainty without proven therapy!

The purpose of this project is twofold:

1. The investigators will study how to improve diagnostic accuracy for HFPEF in elderly patients, despite frequent comorbidities and higher age? How useful is it to add exercise testing and contrast echocardiography as well as biomarker as additional diagnostic tools in elderly HFPEF patients?
2. The investigators will test the hypothesis that HFPEF in the elderly is dominated by multiple co-morbidities that are a major part of the syndrome itself that contribute to the development of HFPEF. This hypothesis implies that the treatment of co-morbidities will improve prognosis.

The investigators' overall goal is to bring about a paradigm shift in managing elderly patients with HFPEF by not only improving diagnosis but also effectively treating co-morbidities that are currently considered predisposing factors to HFPEF. This contrasts with trials during last two decades that only target the heart.

The investigators will pursue the following specific aims:

1. Validate the diagnostic criteria for HFPEF proposed by European Society of Cardiology 2012, and determine the added diagnostic values of exercise testing and contrast echocardiography as well as biomarker for HFPEF in a multi-center study.

NCT01403571,Effectiveness and Safety of Salba on Weight Loss in Overweight Individuals With Type 2 Diabetes,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01403571,LOSS,COMPLETED,"Canadian statistics indicate that the incidence of obesity is increasing and that the occurrence of diabetes in obese individuals is 5-fold greater than those with a healthy weight, making weight control in this population particularly relevant. Preliminary clinical data has shown that the whole grain, Salba, may improve type 2 diabetes control, reduce after-meal blood glucose, cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and suppress appetite. Its use may therefore have potential implications in long-term weight management, while improving diabetes.

The objective of this research (weight loss) is to evaluate whether adding Salba to an energy reduced diet for six months will result in greater weight loss compared to control in overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes. The study recruited 77 overweight or obese individuals with type 2 diabetes. They were instructed to follow a calorie restricted diet and their regular diabetes therapy together with regular exercise. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 30 g Salba/1000 kcal of daily energy requirements, or an oat bran control supplement matched for energy. The effect of the supplements on weight-loss (including waist circumference, % body fat) and glucose control (A1c, fasting glucose levels) will be assessed. In addition, related outcomes such as low-grade body inflammation, hunger-regulating hormones (ghrelin, adiponectin), safety measures (urea, creatinine, ALT and prothrombin time) and satiety scores were evaluated.

Modest weight loss has been associated with improved glucose control in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Addition of Salba to an energy reduced diet may facilitate greater weight loss and improve glycemic control and CVD risk factors compared to such a diet alone. Salba may also promote maintenance of weight loss and therefore help prevent weight gain by providing feelings of fullness that reduce appetite.

The highest concentrations of lutein and zeaxanthin are found in the fovea. Since light entering the eye passes through the MP before reaching the photo receptors it absorbs a significant portion of short-wavelength light. There is evidence that this absorbing properties of the MP as well as the ability of inactivating highly reactive oxygen species are protective for the retina.

Age-related macular degeneration is the leading cause of blindness among developed countries. The pathogenesis of this disease remains unknown.

In preliminary preclinical testing, the investigators have discovered that when wounds are illuminated by violet/blue light, endogenous collagen in the connective tissue matrix emit a characteristic green fluorescent signal, while most pathogenic bacterial species emit a unique red fluorescence signal due to the production of endogenous porphyrins. Therefore, with autofluorescence imaging, no exogenous contrast agents are needed during imaging, making this approach particularly appealing as a diagnostic imaging method for clinical use.

Subjects who participated in the open-label studies MEA115666 or 201312 with at least 6 months of treatment with mepolizumab prior to Visit 1 and who have no more than 2 consecutive missed doses of mepolizumab treatment will be eligible to participate in this study. This study will be conducted in 4 parts in approximately 300 subjects. Part A will be Variable Open-Label Run-in (for subjects with less than 3 years of mepolizumab treatment). Once the required 3 year exposure is reached, subjects will enter Part B- Fixed Open-Label Run-In (4 weeks to 8 weeks). During Part A and B subjects will be administered Open-label mepolizumab (100 milligram \[mg\] Subcutaneous \[SC\]) every 4 weeks. Part C will be the randomized double-blinded part. Upon completion of Part B, eligible subjects will be randomized to mepolizumab (100 mg SC) every 4 weeks or placebo administered SC every 4 weeks for 52 weeks.

Subjects discontinuing investigational product (IP) due to a clinically significant asthma exacerbation will then enter optional Part D of the study. During Part D, subjects receive open-label mepolizumab in addition to their standard of care therapy for the remainder of the study, through Part D up to 52-weeks post-randomization. An Exit Visit will be conducted 52 weeks after randomization in order to assess subject's efficacy parameters, immunogenicity status, and to conduct additional safety assessments. Eligible subjects will participate in the study ranging from 56 to192 weeks, depending on the duration of Part A (0 to 132 weeks) and Part B (4 to 8 weeks).",YES,Asthma,BIOLOGICAL: Mepolizumab 100mg|DRUG: Placebo,"Percentage of Participants With First Clinically Significant Exacerbation in Part C, Clinically significant exacerbation was defined as worsening of asthma which requires use of systemic corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone) for at least 3 days or a single intramuscular (IM) corticosteroid dose and/or hospitalization and/or emergency department (ED) visits. For participants on maintenance systemic corticosteroids, at least double the existing maintenance dose for at least 3 days is required. Percentage of participants with clinically significant exacerbation over time during the on-treatment period of Part C and 95% confidence interval were estimated using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Intent-to-Treat Population includes all randomized participants who received at least one dose of double-blind study medication within Part C., Weeks 12, 24, 36 and 52","Ratio to Baseline in Blood Eosinophil Count in Part C, Blood samples were collected at specific time points to measure blood eosinophils level. Baseline was defined as the latest available assessment prior to first dose of double-blind treatment within Part C. Ratio to Baseline is defined as visit value divided by Baseline value and was analyzed using Mixed Model Repeated Measures with covariates of Baseline, region, exacerbations in the year prior to randomization (as an ordinal variable), Baseline maintenance oral corticosteroids (OCS) therapy (OCS versus no OCS), treatment and visit, plus interaction terms for visit by Baseline and visit by treatment group. The log transformation was applied to blood eosinophil counts prior to analysis. If a blood eosinophil count of zero was reported, a small value was added prior to log transforming the data. The dispersion measure used was log standard error., Baseline and Weeks 12, 24, 36 and 52|Percentage of Participants With 0.5 Point or More Increase in Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ)-5 Score From Baseline in Part C, The ACQ-5 is a five-item, self-completed questionnaire. Five questions (concerning nocturnal awakening, waking in the morning, activity limitation, shortness of breath and wheeze) enquire about the frequency and/or severity of symptoms over the previous week. The response ranges from zero (no impairment/limitation) to six (total impairment/ limitation) scale. Increase in score of \>= 0.5 units from Baseline indicates decrease in asthma control. Baseline is the latest available assessment prior to first dose of double-blind treatment within Part C. Percentage of participants with a 0.5 point or more increase in ACQ-5 score from Baseline over time during the on-treatment period of Part C and its 95% confidence interval were estimated using Kaplan-Meier estimates., Baseline and Weeks 12, 24, 36 and 52|Percentage of Participants With Time to First Exacerbation Requiring Hospitalization or ED Visit in Part C, Exacerbations of asthma requiring hospitalization or ED visit were assessed.

NCT01150071,"Growth, Health and Development in Children Born Extremely Preterm",https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01150071,PEP11,COMPLETED,"Background: In a national Norwegian cohort of children born before 28 weeks gestation or with a birth weight less than 1000 g born in 1999 and 2000, 372 survived. Compared with earlier studies survival increased for the most immature infants, but at the cost of more early complications and a high rate of impairments, while the less immature children had fewer early complications and less impairments detectable within 5 years. These changes show the importance of monitoring outcome as treatment modalities change. Large brain haemorrhages were highly predictive of severe disabilities, but we have not found good predictive factors for milder impairments such as cognitive, behavioural and motor difficulties. However, at 5 years later function may be difficult to predict, and the children's potentials are better understood after completing several years in school. Objectives: The children will be re-examined at age 11 in order to assess their physical and mental health, and cognitive, motor and social function, and to determine if early life events and development at 2 and 5 years are predictive of long term health and functioning. MRI-studies, including functional MRI will be performed to examine if different outcomes related to brain function can be explained by differences in brain development. Methods: For all, data will be collected from the compulsory national test in 5th grade and questionnaires to the child, parents and teacher. For children in Western Norway (n=87) extensive examinations of lung and brain function, including clinical diagnostic tests and MRI, will be added. For all aspects of the study the investigators have appropriate current and historic reference populations for comparison. Implications: Knowledge on causes and of early predictions of outcome is needed to give appropriate advice to families, professionals and society, and to develop preventive programs.",NO,"Infant, Extremely Low Birth Weight|Lung Diseases, Obstructive|Disorder of Bone Density and Structure, Unspecified|Cognition Disorders|Neurobehavioral Manifestations",,"growth, Heigh and weight.

NCT05585671,Belimumab In Prevention of LN,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05585671,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic autoimmune disease, which can involve multiple systems and largely impair patients' health. Kidney is the one of the most commonly affected organs. It was reported that more than about 70% SLE patients developed lupus nephritis, which was highly associated with the long-term prognosis1,2. It will be a great advantage if the high-risk groups could be predicated and prevented with pre-treatment, the renal prognosis and survival would be promisingly improved.

The incidence of lupus nephritis within past 10 years in new-onset SLE patients was recorded in our retrospective study, which was highest in their first-year, about 17%, and about 5% per year in the following years3. The raising of risk prediction models and the recognition of high-risk patients are quite important. The prediction model depends on the collection of patient phenotypes, which are scattered in various forms and very cumbersome. In our previous study, a total of 14,439 SLE patients were collected from the rheumatology and immunology departments of 13 Chinese tertiary hospitals in this study, including 13 062 females (90.46%), with an average age of 33.4 years, and the time span of EMR (Electronic Medical Records) was from October 28, 2001 to March 31, 2017. It includes basic information about patients, physical examination, inspection and diagnostic information, etc. We designed a hybrid NLP system combined NLP technical and expert knowledge at the same time, which was named as Deep Phenotyping System (DPS), to extract all the phenotypic information recorded in EMR.

The DPS efficiently processed EMR data, and its accuracy, precision, and recall were each greater than 93%. It extracted 73 794 entities from 14,439 SLE cases, each with time attributes, and produced 18,785,000,640 entities. Thus, a LN prediction model was raised, which the likelihood of lupus patients without nephritis will develop lupus nephritis within half and one year can be predicted.) More than 35 000 phenotypes were used in this model and it was verified with independent samples. The best accuracy (ACC) and area under the curve (AUC) predicting the 1-year and 2-year risk of developing lupus nephritis can be achieved 0.88 and 0.86 respectively.

The comprehensive SLE phenotype database constructed by NLP greatly improves the research efficiency of lupus clinical phenotype. We first proposed a predictive model of lupus nephritis, which is high applicability and efficiency. The experimental results of good close and open testing fully demonstrate the authenticity and practicality of this database. The research process and method based on real world data are also applicable to predict other important complications of lupus3.

Till now, there were no studies investigating secondary prevention tools of lupus nephritis. However, as we all known, disease flare is a high-risk factor of cruel organ damage, and our previous data showed that lupus nephritis was one of the important flare patterns4. Two phase III, randomized, placebo-controlled studies, BLISS-52 and BLISS-76 showed that belimumab, the only FDA-approved biologic in SLE, targeting B Lymphocyte Stimulator, can reduce disease flares compared to standard-of-care (SOC) therapy5,6. A propensity-score matching study further proved that belimumab add on reduces organ damage progression as measured by SDI7. A pooled post-hoc analysis of the BLISS trials took a deeper look at renal outcome, and suggest that belimumab may offer renal benefit in patients with SLE, indicated by less renal flares in belimumab group, that is 1.1% versus 3.0 in the placebo8.

We hypothesized and tried to analyze that whether belimumab could act as a secondary prevention tool for SLE patients at high-risk.",NO,Whether Belimumab Could Reduce 2-year Risk of New-onset Lupus Nephritis,DRUG: Belimumab,"The percentage of patients who develop lupus nephritis within 24 months, The primary objective was to see whether belimumab could reduce the 24-month risk of developing lupus nephritis.

NCT05234671,Exercise in People With Systemic Sclerosis,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05234671,SScPF,RECRUITING,"Raynaud's phenomenon and digital ulceration are two of the most common disease manifestations leading to digital and/or toe pain in systemic sclerosis (SSc). In addition to pain, fatigue has been identified as a key stressor and the most prevalent and debilitating symptom of SSc. Both, affect significantly quality of life (QoL) domains. Pharmacological therapeutic strategies have not been proved sufficiently effective in the management of SSc-induced pain and fatigue. Evidently the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions (e.g., exercise, cognitive behavioural therapy) is limited, although for some of them (i.e., exercise) evidence is promising. As yet, the effects of a feasible, long-term, tailored exercise programme on pain and fatigue in people with SSc have not been explored. Therefore, the investigators propose a multicentre (n=5) research clinical trial to assess the effect of a previously established, supervised 12-week combined (aerobic and resistance training) exercise programme on pain and fatigue. The 26-month study will recruit 180 people with SSc that will be allocated randomly to two groups.

It is gaining widespread acceptance worldwide as more and more studies are being conducted proving early enteral nutrition to be more physiological, to prevent morphologic and functional trauma related alterations of the gut and to modulate immune and inflammatory responses, and as being less expensive than total parenteral nutrition. Early enteral nutrition is a major component of the recently introduced post operative rehabilitative regimens.

Early feeding has been shown to reduce the risk of any specific infection, mean length of hospital stay, anastomotic dehiscence, wound infection, pneumonia, intra abdominal abscesses. It leads to lower weight loss and early positive nitrogen balance. Hence, overall early enteral nutrition leads to reduced post operative morbidity and better patient outcome.

The goal of the study is to prevent stress and burnout in middle managers and employees in a hospital setting. The study population is middle managers in a hospital setting.

The intervention comprises five training modules with practice in small groups in between. Training will take place over 5 months. The training will be received in groups of 20 middle managers and the training will be facilitated by 2 facilitators. Themes of training are inspired by the concept of Health Oriented Leadership which takes into account that the well-being of managers is important for the well-being of employees. Central themes of the training are: 1) Self-care and well-being of the manager and how to cope with stress as a manager. 2) Employee well-being and reducing risk-factors in the psychosocial working environment of employee mental health problems. 3) Enhancing protective factors social social support and a healthy team climate. 4) Responding to employees at risk and how to handle difficult conversations and procedures on return to work. 5) Managing well-being in employees during changes and pressure.

In order to establish commitment for the waitlist control group, the control group will receive an offer of a webinar and some written information.

Middle managers in both intervention arms will receive a questionnaire at baseline, after the intervention and at 6 months follow-up. The intervention group will also receive a short questionnaire after each training.

The following expectations are hypothesized:

The training will improve self-care and perceived staff-care in middle managers and employees in the intervention group when compared to the control group

The training will improve psychological outcomes of stress, well-being, exhaustion and psychological symptoms among middle managers and employees in the intervention group when compared to the control group

The training will improve the perceived psychosocial working environment (PSWE) among middle managers and employees in the intervention group when compared to the control group

The training will reduce sickness absence and retention among middle managers and employees in the intervention group when compared to the control group

However, the pathophysiology of this arterial hypotension is not unequivocal and could involve, in addition to drug vasoplegia, a mechanical cause linked to lower caval compression or even true or relative hypovolemia. Passive leg raise test has been proposed in an attempt to identify parturients who are more likely to develop low blood pressure after spinal anesthesia. Nevertheless, the data available on this volume expansion test to predict hemodynamic variations after performing spinal anesthesia are still limited and few objective criteria have been described to predict this arterial hypotension.

The main modes of action of music therapy involve sensory, cognitive, psychological and behavioral processes that are also found in pruritus.

Pruritus is defined as ""an uncomfortable sensation causing the need to scratch. It has similarities with pain but also differences: relief by heat / cold, scratching / withdrawal behavior, localization on the skin, semi-mucous / ubiquitous ... etc.

The pathophysiology also has similarities, pruritus is born at the dermal-epidermal junction at the level of specific cutaneous receptors then follows the classical pathways through a 1st neuron, then the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and a second neuron. At the cerebral level, there is no single center of pruritus but several motor and sensory areas involved.

This usually comes under control with judicious use of antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, sedation. Uncontrolled tachycardia in systemic inflammatory response syndrome and sepsis deprives the heart muscle of oxygen. As it progresses, insufficient heart muscle nutrition eventually leads to myocardial dysfunction. It can also present as heart failure. In acute coronary syndromes, beta blockers are used to control heart rate. However in MODS, it cannot be used due to hemodynamic instability and worsened myocardial function.

Sinoatrial (SA) myocytes are the pacemaker cells in the heart. Pacemaker activity involves several ionic currents that influences spontaneous depolarization of SA node including I(f) current. The word I(f) means funny, because this current has unusual properties as compared with other currents known at the time of its discovery. It is one of the most important ionic current for regulating pacemaker activity in SA node.

Ivabradine is an I(f) current inhibitor in SA node. Currently, it is the only agent shown to clinically lower heart rate with no negative inotropism or effects on conduction and contractility.so usage of Ivabradine to control tachycardia in patients with septic shock may help to improve myocardial filling and cardiac output.

Marcos L.Miranda et al. found that Ivabradine was effective in reducing microvascular derangements evoked by experimental sepsis, which was accompanied by less organ dysfunction. These results suggest that ivabradine yields beneficial effects on the microcirculation of septic animals.

NCT03244371,Analysis of the Impact of HCV Treatment by Last Generation Direct Antiviral Agents (DAA) on Antiviral Immunity and HIV DNA Reservoir in Coinfected HIV-HCV Patients,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03244371,HCURE,UNKNOWN,"Spontaneous recovery of patients infected with HCV is related to the development of a cytotoxic immune response that is executed by specialized white blood cells, the CD8+ T cells, which develop a virus-specific response. In addition, the natural killer (NK) cells provide a first-line innate cytotoxic response, which is pivotal for the spontaneous clearing of HCV. In patients where HCV infection settles chronically, CD8+ T lymphocytes and NK cells fall into a state of anergy induced by chronic viral challenge. This anergic state is also found in the case of HIV infection and exacerbated by HIV-HCV coinfection. The first therapeutic strategies against HCV were based on a treatment with interferon alpha, which had an antiviral but also immunosuppressive effect. In fact, this therapeutic strategy was unable to help the recovery of the patient's immune system that would be expected after HCV cure. However, interferon-free therapeutic strategies combining first generation direct antiviral agents (DAA) showed a positive effect on HCV antiviral immunity, by enhancing the proliferative response of CD8+ T cells and the cytotoxic and proinflammatory responses of NK cells in HCV monoinfected patients (4, 5). Since HCV-targeted therapies based on combinations of the latest generation of DAA have nearly 100% cure rates and enable faster viral suppression over shorter treatment times, a positive impact of these regimens on antiviral immunity is plausible. This possibility would be particularly interesting in HIV-HCV co-infected patients, where reactivation of the innate antiviral immunity may contribute to immune defenses against both viruses. Moreover, it has been previously reported a moderate but significant and sustained decline of HIV-1 DNA in CD4 T cells from HIV-1/hepatitis C virus-coinfected patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy and treated with IFN alpha/ribavirin.

To date, the real impact on antiviral immunity of treatment as well as on HIV reservoir with the latest generation of DAA was not measured in HIV-HCV co-infected patients.

The aim of this study is to analyze the impact of the cure of hepatitis C on the HIV DNA reservoir and antiviral function of CD8+ and NK cells in a subgroup of patients receiving the latest generation DAAs for treatment of HCV infection, as part of a program for a reduction of the prevalence of chronic hepatitis C patients co-infected HIV-HCV set up within the Immuno-Hematology Service of the Sainte Marguerite Hospital (Research in routine care-Ethics committee Approval Sud- Méditerranée I ID RCB 2015-A01913-46/ Principal Investigator: Dr I Poizot-Martin).

NCT05356871,Validity and Reliability of a Clinical Method for Assessment of Cardiorespiratory Fitness Using Seismocardiography,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05356871,,COMPLETED,"Measurement of cardiorespiratory fitness (here VO2max) is considered a valuable tool for improving the risk prediction of cardiovascular disease and overall patient management (Ross et al. 2016, American Heart Association statement). However, the gold standard method for determining VO2max requires both maximal exercise until exhaustion and expensive equipment, why it is not always feasible. A new method for estimating VO2max using a non-exercise prediction model with seismocardiography (SCG) information has been proposed (Sørensen et al. 2020, Hansen et al. 2021). SCG is recording and interpretations of vibrations originating from the beating heart measured on the chest wall with an accelerometer. SCG has previously been shown to correlate to physiologic events in the cardiac cycle (Sørensen et al. 2018) and thus a measure of cardiac performance. VO2max is generally believed to be limited by the rate of oxygen delivery to the muscles, where maximal cardiac output and oxygen carrying capacity of the blood are considered the main limiting factors. The theoretical basis for incorporating SCG to a VO2max prediction model is therefore evident. The previous studies by Sørensen et al. 2020 and Hansen et al. 2021 assessed the prediction model in a cross-sectional study design to compare validity of the method. A requirement of further validation of the prediction model with reliability assessment is therefore needed.

Biological age is a concept trying to relate the age to the health status rather than the date of birth. Biological age assesses the heterogeneity in functional metabolic status and vulnerability to disease. A Biological age model has previously been designed for health promotion interventions (Husted et al. 2020). However, reliability assessment of the model is needed.

During times of severe infection (sepsis), the small blood vessels supplying oxygen and nutrients to the skin and other organs (called the microcirculation), become abnormal and do not function as they normally would in health. Monitoring these small blood vessels is difficult to do clinically and the investigators want to investigate a new way of doing this.

The aim of this study is to validate a novel method of assessing the function of the microcirculation in healthy volunteers and patients with sepsis, by measuring the skin temperature profile of the leg and face with a thermal imaging camera. Thermal imaging cameras measure the heat given off by all objects and represents this as a picture, with colour used to represent the different temperatures.

Patients will be recruited from the Emergency Department and Intensive Care Units at University Hospitals of Leicester in to one of two groups based on their illness severity; uncomplicated sepsis and severe sepsis. Healthy volunteers will be recruited in to a third group. Recruitment will take place over a 6-month period with follow-up lasting for 12-months following recruitment. 105 participants will be recruited in total.

Temperature patterns seen on the face and leg will be investigated between the different groups.

However, since cognitive dysfunction is also affected by various accompanying chronic diseases, whether the cognitive dysfunction accompanying AF is due to subclinical ischemic stroke, cerebral hypoperfusion due to reduced cardiac output, inflammatory reaction or platelet dysfunction are unclear.

Non-promising functional return from upper limb rehabilitation has been reported. With the technology advances, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), which is a form of non-invasive direct brain stimulation, may act as an attenuator in regulating or modulating the cortical excitability in order to facilitate cortical re-organization and enhance behavioral performance. Various therapeutic exercise protocols have been investigated regarding their efficacy in promoting motor recovery of the affected upper limb for patients after stroke and the preliminary results were supportive. However, limited numbers of randomized control clinical trials have been published in investigating the ""priming"" or ""additive"" value of low frequency repetitive TMS (rTMS) with combination of structural motor training programs.

NCT04189471,Recovery After Cerebral Hemorrhage,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04189471,REACH,RECRUITING,"Background:

While the intensive care of patients with life-threatening brain illnesses has advanced tremendously, a large number of therapies are still without proper scientific support.

This can be partly explained by the fact that mechanisms of initial brain injury are still not well understood. Why additional neurological injury occurs during a patient's stay in the NeuroCritical Care Unit (NCCU) despite current best, evidence-based clinical practices, is also not well understood. However, over the past decade, better tools have become available to measure and monitor the impact of our clinical care on the rapidly changing physiology and chemistry of the injured brain. Some of these tools are CT, MRI, ultrasound, and catheter-based technology measuring blood flow and metabolism. These tools have enabled earlier detection of injury and complications and newer therapeutic strategies.

Purpose:

Examine disease pathways common to all brain injuries seen in the University of Maryland's 22-bed NCCU. Life-threatening neurological illnesses cared for in the NCCU include massive stroke, bleeding in and around the brain (subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage, subdural hemorrhage, intraventricular hemorrhage), brain tumors, difficult to control seizures, neurologic infections, nerve and muscle diseases (such as myasthenia gravis or Guillain-Barre Syndrome), and spinal cord disorders among others. Many NCCU patients are comatose or paralyzed and may suffer injuries in other parts of the body as well.

This effort will require the creation of a robust clinical database for the capture of data including patient characteristics (age, sex), clinical characteristics, medical treatments, surgical interventions, physiological data (such as vital signs, cerebral blood flow, intracranial pressure, cerebral oximetry, etc), laboratory data, and standard-of-care diagnostic studies such as electroencephalography (EEG), ultrasound, CT, MRI, and angiograms. Similar databases exist at other major centers for neurocritical care and have been instrumental to the identification of characteristics both predictive of and associated with outcomes of patients long after their stay in the NCCU.

In addition, the samples collected will be included in the University of Maryland Medicine (UMM) Biorepository which is a shared resource to enable biomedical research by University of Maryland faculty.",NO,Intra Cerebral Hemorrhage|Subarachnoid Hemorrhage|Intraventricular Hemorrhage|Nontraumatic Haemorrhage,,"Number of participants who score great than 60 on the Barthel Index, The Barthel scale is an ordinal scale used to measure performance in activities of daily living.

Having a unnecessary ""deep"" anesthesia level can be harmful, causing acute renal failure, injure to myocard, cause delirium and increase the mortality rate. Being too ""light"", on the other hand, can make the patient experience awareness when muscle relaxant is used. This can lead to serious psychological struggles.

Evaluating the depth of anesthesia is the most important task of the anesthesia team, but can be difficult because clinical signs depend on many factors. In addition to clinical evaluation, EEG is commonly used for interpreting the level of anesthesia in todays practice. Unfortunately, this method is not always accurate and has a delay.

NCT05025371,The Role of Systemic Immuno-inflammatory Factors in Resectable Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05025371,,COMPLETED,"Pancreatic cancer is a highly aggressive malignancy, its prognosis remaining poor despite the current advances in treatment. Systemic inflammatory reaction has been recently recognized as an important factor in the progression of cancer. The immune-inflammatory response has been measured through different scores or ratios, that combine the values of circulating immune cells, like neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), prognostic nutritional index (PNI). The utility of these scores in different types of cancer has been more and more discussed. In pancreatic cancer, there has been no definite conclusion regarding the role of systemic immune-inflammatory factors; since controversies still exist, a deeper exploration of this subject, through more studies is welcomed. Our study intends to analyze the utility of systemic immune-inflammatory markers in resectable pancreatic cancer.

Our study is an observational cohort study, with retrospective data collection; it is a single-center study, that takes place in a hospital with experience in hepato-bilio-pancreatic surgery. The investigators intended to evaluate the role of the circulating immune cells (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes) and different immune-inflammatory scores (NLR, LMR, PLR, SII, PNI) in predicting the overall survival of patients diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, that undergo curative surgical treatment. The investigators intended to assess the prognosis power of these factors in both preoperative and postoperative settings, as well as their dynamic after surgery. Through this study, the investigators hope to identify easy-to determine and easy-to-use markers that can be incorporated in clinical practice and that can effectively predict survival in pancreatic cancer patients. Nonetheless, the investigators want to explore the dynamic of the immune-inflammatory markers after curative surgery.",NO,"Pancreas Cancer, Duct Cell Adenocarcinoma",OTHER: Systemic immune-inflammatory markers,"Overall survival, The last time of follow-up was April 2021",,,Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy,Institutul Regional de Gastroenterologie & Hepatologie Prof. dr.

There are several methods of cardiac physiological stress tests and each of them offer varied insight into cardiac physiological adaptation: passive leg raise, intra-venous fluid challenge, pharmacological stressors and physical exercise stress test. Echocardiography, which is the mainstay for the non-invasive rest/stress assessment of the left ventricular (LV) haemodynamics has several limitations. Novel methods of CMR imaging allow to map intra-cardiac flow in three-dimension using novel flow acquisitions. These novel flow acquisitions are called four-dimensional flow CMR, where the fourth dimension is time. Additionally, traditional cine CMR imaging for functional assessment can now be done without breath-holds using advanced acceleration methods, allowing them to be used during exercise. A comprehensive understanding of functional-flow coupling at rest, during increased pre-load (fluid challenge) to the heart or during exercise, is lacking in the literature. There is an important need to validate these novel CMR methods for developing mechanistic insight into physiological cardiac adaptation to increased pre-load or to exercise in health and how it alters in heart disease.",NO,Heart Failure|Pulmonary Hypertension|Myocardial Infarction|Coronary Artery Disease,OTHER: intravenous fluid challenge,"4D CMR Flow, The primary outcome measures will include 4D flow CMR derived mitral inflow diastolic parameter: E/A ratio.

NCT04809571,Non-invasive Photoacoustic Imaging of Skin Inflammatory Disorders With Machine Learning-assisted Scoring,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04809571,,RECRUITING,"Inflammatory skin disorders are usually assessed by disease scoring system such as Scoring AD (SCORAD)/Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) for atopic eczema and psoriasis respectively. The current approach to score the severity of these inflammatory skin disorders is through clinical observations and questionnaires. These scores however do not reflect the structural characteristics of the skin such as morphology, vasculature architecture and dermis thickness and are subject to inter and intra-assessor variability. Objective inflammatory diseases indicators through non-invasive imaging techniques have the potential to be an important clinical tool to shed light on its severity in an objective manner. Furthermore, given the abundance of cutaneous vasculature, non-invasive imaging in patients with chronic inflammatory skin conditions allows the investigators to evaluate in detail how co-morbidities of metabolic syndrome, especially type 2 diabetes, further affects the vasculature or the epidermis in the skin. It helps to answer the question of whether a tighter control of the ""overlying"" skin condition helps in management of the underlying co-morbidities.

Currently, there are many skin imaging modalities available to visualize the morphology and vascular architecture non-invasively, but they are hindered by their penetration depth and lack of contrast. Examples include optical coherence tomography (OCT), high-frequency ultrasound, and Doppler based ultrasound. In this study, these shortcomings will be circumvented through the usage of photoacoustic mesoscopic imaging, a non-invasive, high resolution, intrinsic or contrast-enhanced imaging technique, which can provide functional and metabolic information at greater depths, and an optical fibre-based handheld confocal Raman spectroscopy system with inbuilt data processing algorithms and software, which allows for highly effective and accurate analysis of various skin constituents, such as ceramides, filaggrin, and hydration.

In the first year, we had established a CADL item bank of 50 items. The investigators will administer the 50 items on 300 patients with stroke living in the community. Then we will select 10 to 15 items from the item bank for the CADL scale based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), the opinions of an expert panel, and Rasch analysis. It is anticipated that the CADL scale will have unidimensionality, an interval level of measurement, soundly psychometric characteristics, a reduced number of items, and ease of administration.

In the second and third years, we will compare the psychometric properties of the CADL scale and the combined BI and FAI scale. The psychometric properties investigated will include reliability (e.g. inter-rater reliability, intra-rater reliability, and internal consistency), validity (e.g. concurrent validity, convergent validity, predictive validity and discriminant validity), and responsiveness.

NCT05038371,Connective Tissue Growth Factor in Patients With Neovascular Age Related Macular Degeneration,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05038371,,TERMINATED,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) remains a leading cause of blindness in United States and can be broadly divided into two forms: non-neovascular AMD (NNVAMD) and neovascular AMD (NVAMD) AMD. Among the several mechanisms underlying AMD, hypoxia and oxidative stress have been implicated and cause upregulation of several signaling proteins. About 20% of patients with NNVAMD develop choroidal neovascularization and hence convert to NVAMD. Upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a critical role in conversion from NNVAMD to NVAMD.

Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a polypeptide that has been shown to be overexpressed in various fibrotic disorders, suggesting its involvement in scarring. After the development of choroidal neovascularization, subretinal fibrosis may occur and result in permanent reduction of vision. An important question is, does CTGF contribute to subretinal fibrosis. An important first step in addressing this question is to determine if CTGF levels are increased in the eyes of patients with NVAMD and this is the objective of this study.

The investigators plan to measure levels of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in the aqueous humor of patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration and compare to controls. Levels of VEGF will be measured as a positive control.",NO,Wet Macular Degeneration,,"Measurement of aqueous humor levels of CTGF by ELISA, Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) levels will be measured, using ELISA, in aqueous samples of both patients and controls., Baseline visit|Measurement of aqueous humor levels of VEGF by ELISA, Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels will be measured, using ELISA, in aqueous samples of both patients and controls.

NCT01611571,Combination Risedronate - Parathyroid Hormone Trial in Male Osteoporosis,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01611571,RPM,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this study is to develop new treatment options for osteoporosis in men. The Investigators will study two medications and three treatment regimens. First, risedronate (FDA approved) will be studied as monotherapy. Second, the investigators will study injectable parathyroid hormone (PTH 134, teriparatide; FDA approved), as a therapy for male osteoporosis. PTH, a naturally occurring hormone produced by the parathyroid glands, is one of the most important regulators of bone metabolism. The drug being studied in this protocol, teriparatide, is the first aminoterminal 34 amino acids of the native 84amino acid peptide. Teriparatide contains all of the classical biological activities of native PTH. In studies of postmenopausal women, in a small study of 23 men with osteoporosis and a larger study of 437 men treatment with teriparatide led to significant increases in bone density. Although teriparatide and actonel are now approved for osteoporosis in men additional studies of these medications are needed in order to establish how best to use these drugs. This study is focused on an entirely new treatment approach, namely the combination of two medications for the treatment of osteoporosis risedronate with teriparatide to evaluate whether combination therapy is superior to therapy with either medication alone.

NCT01984671,Mobile Pain Coping Skills Training for Stem Cell Transplant Patients,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01984671,,COMPLETED,"Persistent pain is a major challenge for patients who undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and is related to more fatigue, more physical disability, poorer quality of life, and poorer medical adherence. There is a need to examine strategies for managing pain in HSCT patients that can complement existing analgesic regimens. Strong evidence suggests that cognitive and behavioral factors play an important role in HSCT patients' ability to manage their pain. The investigator has found that HSCT patients having low levels of confidence (i.e., self-efficacy) in their ability to control pain and high use of maladaptive coping strategies (i.e., pain catastrophizing) experience increased pain and disability. A psychosocial intervention that modifies patients' cognitive and behavioral pain coping strategies may benefit HSCT patients. Protocols, particularly Pain Coping Skills Training (PCST), have been developed for reducing pain and improving quality of life in patients with persistent pain. However, HSCT patients with persistent pain face a number of unique challenges that must be considered when applying a PCST protocol. The investigator proposes to develop and test a Mobile Health Pain Coping Skills (mPCST) protocol for HSCT patients with persistent pain to meet the challenges of HSCT patients with pain as they transition from hospital based care to their home environment. The first aim of this study is to use an iterative development model to design a mPCST intervention protocol for HSCT patients that targets increasing self-efficacy for pain control and decreasing pain catastrophizing. The study team will use focus groups with patients and HSCT providers to guide development along with user testing with HSCT patients having pain. The second aim of this study is to use a small randomized controlled trial to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and engagement in the developed mPCST protocol. The third aim is to obtain an estimate of the effect size of the developed mPCST protocol on decreased pain, pain disability, physical disability, and adherence to post-transplant lifestyle recommendations impacted by pain when compared to a standard care control condition. Proposed innovative features of the mPCST protocol that will be developed include: extensive input from PCST and HSCT experts and HSCT patients with pain; an initial session prior to discharge with subsequent sessions occurring at home via video-conferencing; incorporation of strategies to decrease the impact of pain on adherence to critical post-transplant lifestyle recommendations; a real-time daily assessment system with subsequent tailored feedback. If the developed mPCST protocol demonstrates feasibility, acceptability, engagement, and promising effect sizes to influence pain and other indices of quality of life, a larger NIH grant will be sought to examine this protocol in a larger sample of patients, test the protocol against an active treatment, and investigate a broader array of outcomes (e.g., medication adherence). This mPCST protocol could also be examined in other patient populations with pain facing similar challenges (e.g., live far from medical center, travel limitations).",NO,Stem Cell Transplant,BEHAVIORAL: Mobile Pain Coping Skills Training,"Accrual, Accrual into this study will be used as the main outcome measure to examine feasibility of the intervention., 22 months","Pain Levels, Pain as measured by the Brief Pain Inventory., 22 months",,Duke University,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,72,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,Pro00047952,2013-11-12,2015-10-15,2015-10-15,2013-11-15,,2022-08-03,"Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, 27708, United States",

The disease is characterized by recurrent, severe pain crises which result in high rates of emergency department visits and hospitalizations, and decreased quality of life. The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, as well as the American Society of Hematology, have endorsed pain management guidelines regarding the timeliness of care for children presenting with these acute pain crises. These evidence-based guidelines are infrequently followed, resulting in increased pain and hospitalizations. In additional to other barriers to following the guideline, structural racism has been proposed as a significant contributor and the New England Journal of Medicine recently called for the institution of SCD-specific pain management protocols to combat structural racism and reduce time to opioid administration. The investigators' long-term goal is to improve the care and health outcomes of children with acute painful vaso-occlusive crisis treated in the emergency department.

Between March 2006 and March 2007, in Calgary, Alberta, there were 1500 presentations of epistaxis to adult emergency rooms with 7% of these (105 patients) requiring packing with admission. Common methods to control epistaxis include, nasal packing (88%), operative arterial ligation (10%), and arterial embolization (2%). A cost analysis demonstrated that nasal packing had a lower cost compared to embolization and arterial ligation, and all modalities had similar lengths of stay (Goddard, Otolaryng Head Neck Surg. 2006). Arterial ligation is the current recommended therapy for recurrent or refractory epistaxis, with a success rate of 98%. With the advancement of endoscopic techniques, emergency room Minimally Invasive Control of Epistaxis (M.I.C.E.) allows for selective packing and cauterization, which provides the patient with retained function of their nasal cavity and prevents a hospital admission, resulting in significant cost savings.

NCT01644071,Serotonergic System and Violent Video Games,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01644071,Serogen,COMPLETED,"Aggressive behavior (AB) is a major burden to society with severe socio-economic consequences. Genetic studies suggest a high heritability of AB; in particular, the low expressing allele of the MAOA gene (MAOA-L) has been associated with increased AB. Recent neural aggression models have suggested a dysfunctional emotion regulation circuit including amygdala, orbitofrontal, and anterior cingulate cortex. Dysregulated serotonergic (5-HT) projections from the anterior cingulate cortex to the amygdala have been suggested to promote aggressive behavior. This finding is well in line with the observation that the MAOA-L allele leads to a reduced expression of monoamine oxidase A and thus to an overflow of 5-HT in serotonergic cortico-amygdalar projections. However, due to methodological and ethical constraints, the neural substrates of AB are difficult to assess. A possible solution is the use of virtual violence which permits AB against virtual characters without direct consequences for any real person and can be easily applied in functional imaging experiments. There is evidence that virtual and real aggression share common neural substrates. AB in violent video games inhibits rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and amygdala in line with the suggested neurophysiological circuits underlying real-life AB.",NO,Healthy Volunteers,DRUG: cipralex,"functional neuroimaging, 1 day",,,RWTH Aachen University,,MALE,ADULT,NA,47,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: BASIC_SCIENCE",CTC-A_12-023,2012-02,2014-02,2014-06,2012-07-18,,2015-09-29,"Department of Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, University Hospital Aachen, Aachen, 52074, Germany",

Unfortunately it seems that, after the initial therapy, many patients still present with active pockets (residual pockets) requiring further treatment and posing a risk of disease progression.

Physical exam

Medical history and medicine review

Surveys about CGD and how it affects their life

Studies report low rates of adherence to AET (38% to 86%) and in our preliminary work, 65% of breast cancer patients taking AET reported one or more non-adherent medication taking behaviors (e.g., skipped dose, forgot, adjusted dose) in the past month. Symptoms (e.g., arthralgia, vasomotor symptoms) associated with AET are strongly related to non-adherence and early discontinuation of treatment. Poor adherence to AET due to symptoms may compromise the effectiveness of AET. Prior to conducting a clinical trial, we will conduct user testing of the self-management intervention protocol with 20 women. In the proposed randomized clinical trial, 400 women who are taking AET for breast cancer will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions: 1) a self-management intervention for improving adherence and symptom management, or 2) a general health education control condition. The self-management intervention integrates three key theory-based strategies for improving adherence to AET: coping skills training for managing symptoms (e.g., arthralgia, vasomotor symptoms), behavioral strategies for improving medication adherence, and symptom and medication education. The intervention addresses the specific symptoms a woman is experiencing and is designed to meet the needs of women who are at high risk for non-adherence to AET (e.g., low socioeconomic status, low literacy). The self-management intervention is administered by a nurse via the telephone, and combines the use of phone calls and tailored interactive voice messaging based on information exchanged during phone sessions and real-time adherence data obtained from smart medication bottles. Women randomly assigned to the control condition will receive a general health education intervention that is delivered by a nurse via the telephone. This study will take place in the Duke Cancer Institute breast clinic and in community hospitals that are members of the Duke Cancer Network, which will allow access to women receiving care outside the medical center setting and increase generalizability of findings to a variety of settings. Adherence to AET will be assessed over the 18 month period following study enrollment using wireless smart medication bottles that provide real-time adherence data and pill counts completed by study staff during in-person study assessments. Patient-reported outcome measures assessing symptoms, perceived necessity of AET, concerns about AET, and self-efficacy will be obtained at baseline and 3, 6, 12, and 18 months.

As a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, CD47 is expressed at low levels on many cells of the body, including hematopoietic cells (red blood cells, lymphocytes, platelets, etc.) and non-hematopoietic cells (placenta, liver and brain cells). It is overexpressed on many types of tumors. There is abundant supportive evidence that the expression of CD47 on tumor cells, though binding to SIRP on professional phagocytes, acts to prevent tumor cell phagocytosis, inhibit antigen cross-presentation, and block the production of pro-inflammatory molecules, thus promoting the development of a ""cold"" tumor microenvironment. Blocking CD47 can not only stimulate phagocytosis to cancer cells, but also promote macrophage recruitment towards neoplasm. At the same time, blocking CD47 can stimulate macrophages to secrete cytokines. These cytokines and chemokines can further recruit other immune cells to neoplasms. These newly recruited immune cells can provide a positive feedback and enhance the therapeutic response of blocking CD47. Therefore, the CD47/SIRPα axis blocking appears to be a potential therapeutic target for neoplasm.

Currently, no anti-CD47 antibody product has been granted marketing authorization for progressive hematological malignancies. Whereas Hu5F9-G4, a CD47 monoclonal antibody, is being tested in a series of ongoing clinical trials for AML, MDS, lymphomas and multiple solid tumors. The clinical research was designed based on non-clinical data and relevant experience of other CD47 monoclonal antibody.

In this phase Ia study, ""3 + 3"" dose escalation method combined with rapid titration will be used to evaluate the dose limiting (DLT) toxicity of each dose group, evaluate the safety and tolerance of Gentulizumab in the treatment of patients with progressive hematological malignancies, and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and phase II recommended dose (RP2D); At the same time, the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), immunogenicity, preliminary efficacy and biomarkers of gentulizumab will be evaluated to provide sufficient basis for new drug application (NDA) guidance and further clinical use.",NO,Acute Myelogenous Leukemia|Myelodysplastic Syndromes,DRUG: Gentulizumab,"adverse events (AEs), Adverse events (AEs) refer to all adverse medical events occurred in subjects after the informed consent was signed, which may represent symptoms, signs, diseases, or laboratory examination abnormalities, but do not necessarily have a causal relationship with the investigational drug., ICF signing to 90 days after last administration or initiation of new anti-tumor treatment|serious adverse events (SAEs), 1.

NCT02222571,Formative Research - Developing a Family-based Obesity Prevention Intervention in the Canadian Context,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02222571,,COMPLETED,"This formative research shows that parents of preschool-aged children are enthusiastic about learning general parenting skills, such as discipline strategies, but that they are less interested in information on child nutrition and physical activity needs. To capitalize on this enthusiasm, Dr. Haines developed Parents and Tots Together (PTT), an intervention that embeds strategies to improve children's nutrition and activity behaviours within an existing general skills parenting program. Results from the investigators feasibility trial with 16 Boston-area parents show that PTT is feasible for implementation and is extremely well-received by parents. Results are also encouraging with respect to changing parent feeding behaviours and children's nutrition and activity behaviours. What is not known is whether this program is feasible and contextually appropriate for Canadian families. Thus, the next step in this research program, and the overall goal of this study, is to assess Parents and Tots Together (PTT), a family-based intervention to prevent obesity among children 3 to 5 years of age, within the Canadian context.

To achieve this goal, the investigators will conduct a pilot trial of the PTT program with 60 families recruited through Ontario Early Years Centres (OEYC). The investigators will randomize 30 families to the 3-month PTT intervention and 30 to a control condition.

The investigators primary objective is to implement and test the feasibility and acceptability of PTT among families with preschool children so appropriate revisions can be made to adapt it to a Canadian context. The investigators secondary objective is to compare the following outcomes among intervention versus control participants:

1. Parent weight-related behaviours (i.e., parent physical activity, intake of sugar-sweetened beverages, and television/video viewing, as well as responsiveness to child satiety cues).
2. General parenting behaviours (i.e., use of positive discipline strategies).
3. Child weight-related behaviours (i.e., sleep duration, physical activity, intake of sugar-sweetened beverages, television/video viewing).

The TLFB is a structured interview using calendar-based anchors to assess weekly drug use. UDS is a weekly urine dipstick for substance use; the urine cup has a multi-drug 12 panel test on the cup's surface, which detects several substances including opiates, and uses concentrations levels established by SAMSHA. A participant will be coded as positive for use (i.e., having relapsed) if: (a) the participant self-reported use for that week; or (b) the participant denied use, but provided a positive urine drug screen for opioids. Relapse will be ascertained in 30-day periods. At baseline, a Timeline Followback (TLFB)8 for the 30 days before admission will be obtained (with opioid use separated from other drug use) and a urine drug screen collected. For follow-up assessments, the TLFB for the previous 60 days, 3 months, 3 months post and 6 months post will be obtained., 9 months|Cravings, Cravings as measured by the Opioid Craving Scale (OCS), a modification of the Cocaine Craving Scale will be utilized to assess opioid craving. The OCS consists of three items rated on a visual analogue scale from 0-10: (1) How much do you currently crave opiates? (rated from not at all to extremely), (2) In the past week, please rate how strong your desire to use opiates has been when something in the environment has reminded you of opiates (rated from no desire to extremely strong), and (3) Please imagine yourself in the environment in which you previously used opiates. If you were in this environment today and if it were the time of day that you typically used opiates, what is the likelihood that you would use opiates today?

Two samples will be acquired at each assessment session to represent resting baseline cortisol levels, stress induced cortisol levels to drug-related cues, and return to rest levels. To minimize diurnal cycle effects, assessment will take place in the afternoon when cortisol is lower, and reactivity can be detected. After 20 minutes at rest, five mL of saliva will be collected via the passive drool. Next, participants will watch a 20-minute video depicting drug cues.

NCT03048071,Morbimortality of Contegra Duct Replacements Versus Homografts in Pulmonary Position,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03048071,,COMPLETED,"Congenital heart diseases are nowadays frequently treated in newborns. These congenital heart defects can directly affect the right ventricular ejection tract (RVOT), or sometimes indirectly, when the left ventricular ejection tract (LVOT) is replaced by the ROVT in a Ross operation. Originally introduced by Ross and Somerville in 1966, the reconstruction of ROVT by valved homografts is since then widely used.Pulmonary and aortic homografts then constituted the gold standard in conduit replacement between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery (VD-AP).

The increasing demand for homografts currently induces a shortage and unmet demands. This lack of availability, and the durability of homografts in young patients, has encouraged the search for alternative conducts.For example, in 1999, Medtronic® put a bovine jugular vein xenograft (VJB) on the market, the Contegra® conduct, as alternative for the homograft for RVOT reconstruction. This duct naturally has a central valve with three valvules, and there is on both sides of the valve a generous duct length allowing unique adaptation options. This conduit, however, is not perfect.

Whether using Contegra® ducts or homografts, replacement is inevitable.

Prematurity remains a major risk factor, although children born at term represent 52% of children with cerebral palsy in France. Recent international and national (Haute Autorité de Santé, Troubles du neurodéveloppement - Repérage et orientation des enfants à risque, February 2020) recommendations emphasize the importance of continuous, early, and systematic management of infants at risk of cerebral palsy before 6 months of corrected age (CA), which is beneficial on the motor, cognitive, and social development of these children into preschool age. The principles of early identification and therapeutic intervention, which are at the core of multi-professional care, are becoming better known.

The priorities of this care are: the identification of high-risk infants, the continuity of follow-up from the neonatal period and after the return home in order to detect motor developmental disorders as early as possible, with a the global approach centered on the family. From the neonatal period, parents have traumatic experiences and are subjected to sources of stress. A framework of trust must be established during hospitalization, and preventive, multidisciplinary post-hospitalization follow-up is necessary. Informing families about the risks of motor developmental disorders that may affect their child and about the necessary follow-up in the first months is essential to obtain their adherence to an early course of action. This should take place even before parents have noticed abnormalities, and without waiting for a proven disability. However, it is necessary to support parents in these difficult situations by trying to reduce stress and to preserve the role of the parent.

Finally, the ESPaCe survey reveals several of the challenges faced by parents of children with CP: difficulty in finding trained therapists, low frequency of sessions, heterogeneity of rehabilitation techniques, and 75% of parents felt excluded from care and wish to be more involved. Fondation Motrice has therefore suggested developing recommendations for good clinical practice based on scientific evidence to address these difficulties.

In this context, the physiotherapists of the CHU Dijon Bourgogne have implemented the recommended early identification tools in the traditional perinatal follow-up pathway by collaborating with the neonatologists and rehabilitation physicians of the CHU Dijon Bourgogne. After the child goes home from the hospital, professionals can ensure continuity and adapt developmental support care by continuing to accompany the families. The follow-up pathway currently offered to these high-risk children includes a motor assessment at 4, 9 and 24 months of corrected age, with an additional consultation at 18 months of corrected age depending on the child's neurodevelopment. However, the psychological impact of this type of pathway on the parents, their satisfaction and their level of adherence to this care pathway are currently unknown.

Therefore, the objective of the DéStreSs study is to describe the level of parental stress and whether is varies over time, the consumption of care, parent satisfaction, and adherence to the follow-up program currently offered at the Dijon Bourgogne University Hospital.",NO,Cerebral Palsy,OTHER: Parenting Stress Index (PSI)|OTHER: Collection of health care consumption|OTHER: Assessment of parent satisfaction,"Parenting Stress Index (PSI), throughout the visits until the child reaches 24 months of corrected age",,,Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Dijon,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,60,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,KRUMM 2021-2,2022-04-22,2025-10,2025-10,2022-02-10,,2022-05-10,"CHU Dijon Bourgogne, Dijon, France",

Despite their good appetite, many females with RTT meet the criteria for moderate to severe malnutrition. The pathological mechanism is barely understood. Although feeding difficulties may play a part in this, other constitutional factors as altered metabolic processes are suspected. Irregular breathing is a common clinical feature, reflecting the immaturity of the brainstem in RTT. The primary pathophysiology is a defective control mechanism of carbon dioxide exhalation that leads to chronic respiratory alkalosis or acidosis. We assume that chronic respiratory acidosis or alkalosis causes derangement of the metabolic equilibrium in RTT females with important nutritional consequences.

NCT00594971,"A Shared Care Approach for Seriously Ill Cancer Patients Between General Practice, Discharge Department and a Specialist Palliative Care Team",https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00594971,,WITHDRAWN,"Background:

Approximately one third of all deaths in Denmark are caused by cancer. Both Danish and international research shows that the majority of terminally ill cancer patients wish to die at home. In Denmark only about 25% has this wish fulfilled. The General Practitioner (GP) has traditionally had the full responsibility for the palliative care of terminally ill cancer patients. In recent years changes have been made to the organisation of palliative care: some hospitals have set up specialised palliative care teams and in some areas of Denmark hospices have been established.

Recent research defines a problem when it comes to communication between the hospital and general practice when the patient is being discharged. This is often done in a way that can cause the patient to feel ""left in limbo"", especially if it is not completely clear to the patient and his or her relatives who has the responsibility for the palliative care.

Objective:

1. To describe consequences for patients, relatives and health care professionals of three different ways of organising palliative care
2. To collect data which describes patients who are candidates to a shared care approach between general practice and a specialised palliative care team
3. To collect data which describes the palliative phase (place of death and palliative care, admissions to hospital, involvement of GP and district nurse etc.)
4. To describe terminally ill cancer patients and their relatives expectations of the health care system

Stroke is a complex disease with multiple interacting risk factors (including genetic, high blood pressure and cholesterol, and lifestyle factors like smoking, diet, and exercise) that lead to initial and recurrent stroke. Up to 90% of stroke survivors have some functional deficit that impacts both physical and mental health.

Scientific evidence that identifies the best stroke care delivery design is lacking. We completed a three-year, Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services (CMS) Health Care Innovation Award that tested a new stroke care design called an Integrated Practice Unit (IPU). This IPU was developed through stakeholder input from patients, caregivers, nurses, stroke specialists, rehabilitation specialists, patient advocacy groups, payers, and technology companies. This IPU design was associated with decreased hospital length of stay, readmissions, and stroke recurrence, as well as lower cost.

Based on the CMS study, a larger, pragmatic trial was developed that is called C3FIT (Coordinated, Collaborative, Comprehensive, Family-based, Integrated, and Technology-enabled Stroke Care). C3FIT will randomly assign 18 US hospital sites to continue Joint Commission-certified Comprehensive/Primary (CSC/PSC) design or to the novel Integrated Stroke Practice Unit (ISPU) design for stroke care. C3FIT's ISPU uses team-based, enhanced collaboration (called Stroke Central) and follows patients from presentation at the Emergency Department (ED) through 12-months post-discharge (called Stroke Mobile). Stroke Mobile includes a nurse and lay health educator team who visit patients and caregivers at home or at a rehabilitation or skilled nursing facility to assess function and quality of life using telehealth technology to facilitate access to multiple providers.

This is characterised as a perception that the replaced knee is unsteady during certain tasks.

NCT02104271,Comparison Between Two Different Parameters of Argon Plasma Coagulation in the Treatment of Chronic Radiation Proctitis: Historical Control Trial.,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02104271,,COMPLETED,"There is a wide variability of options for treatment of chronic radiation proctitis. However, studies are still limited, usually case reports from a single center and few are comparative studies between methods. Therefore, the choice of treatment is determined by availability and local expertise for each method. The variability of treatment options range from anti-inflammatory medical treatment, sucralfate, short chain fatty acids, antioxidants and hyperbaric oxygen to such endoscopic and surgical treatments. Surgery is usually the last therapeutic option due to the high morbidity and mortalityassociated. Various endoscopic treatment modalities have been reported. Formalin topic is effective in up to 48% of patients with chronic radiation proctitis.

Healthy volunteers between 21 and 40 years of age may be eligible for this study. They must be non-smokers and have no history of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes. Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, and blood tests. This study is either done in the NIH Clinical Center intensive care unit or on the general clinical ward. Participants are enrolled in Part A of the study. After completion of Part A participants will be enrolled in Part B of the study.

Part A:

Participants lie in a reclining chair during the study. Small catheters (plastic tubes) are inserted into an artery and vein in the forearm. Another tube is placed in the vein of the opposite arm. Blood pressure cuffs are placed around the upper arm and wrist, and a strain gauge (a rubber band-like device) is placed around the forearm. This device helps us to measure blood flow through the arm. When the blood pressure cuffs are inflated, blood flows into the forearm, stretching the strain gauge at a rate proportional to the blood flow. Pressure cuffs and a strain gauge are also placed on the other arm. After 20 minutes, blood pressure and blood flow are measured in both forearms. Then blood is drawn from the tube in the right vein to measure blood counts, proteins, and other chemicals. Participants then are given small doses of either saline, ascorbic acid, or a medicine called oxypurinol, a form of a drug that is often taken to prevent gout. After 30 minutes, sodium nitrite is injected in increasing doses into the artery for 30 minutes. Blood flow is measured and blood is drawn every 5 minutes during the infusion. At the end of the 30 minutes, blood is drawn from the vein every 30 minutes for 3 hours. After 3 hours, sodium nitrite infusions are restarted for 2 hours and blood flow is measured and samples collected every 30 minutes during this period.

Part B: Participants lie in a reclining chair during the study. A small catheter (plastic tube) is placed in the artery of the left forearm to draw blood samples. A larger catheter called a central line is placed in a deeper vein in the neck. Another tube is advanced through the central line into the chambers of the heart, through the heart valve, and into the lung artery to measure pressures in the heart and lungs. Blood is drawn after 30 minutes to obtain baseline measurements. Then saline (sterile salt water) is put into the tube in the lung artery. Blood pressure cuffs are placed around the upper arm and wrist, and a strain gauge (a rubber band-like device) is placed around the forearm, which helps us to measure flow through the arm. When the cuffs are inflated, blood flows into the forearm, stretching the strain gauge at a rate proportional to the blood flow. Pressure cuffs and a strain gauge are also placed on the other arm. After 20 minutes, blood pressure and blood flow are measured in the forearm and blood samples are drawn from the tube in the left artery to measure blood counts, proteins, and other chemicals.

Subjects then breathe a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen through a facemask for 30 minutes, then room air for 30 minutes, and then the oxygen and nitrogen mixture for another 30 minutes. While breathing the mixture the second time, sodium nitrite is injected through the tube in the artery in three increasing doses for 5 minutes each. Every 5 minutes during the infusion blood is drawn from the tubes in the neck. Forearm blood flow is also measured every 5 minutes. After 30 minutes, the subject breathes room air for 3 hours and 15 minutes and then the sodium nitrite is injected again in three increasing doses for 5 minutes each.

Internal reliability of the scale ranged from .89 to .91 and it shows adequated validity (Reinhard, Gubman, Horwitz \& Minsky, 1994)., Changes will be assessed from pre-treatment to immediately after the intervention, and also at 6-month-follow-up.|Family Assessment Device - Global Functioning Scale (FAD-GFS; Epstein, Baldwin & Bishop, 1983)., Family Assessment Device - Global Functioning Scale (FAD-GFS) is a self-report questionnaire (Epstein, Baldwin \& Bishop, 1983). It consists of 60 items about family functioning. It is composed of seven subscales: Problem-Solving, Communication, Roles, Affective Responsiveness, Affective Involvement, Behavior Control and General Functioning. Items are rated on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (totally agree) to 4 (totally disagree), and higher scores indicate unhealthy functioning. Cronbach's alphas ranges from .72 to .83 for the subscales and general functioning is .92 (Miller, Epstein, Bishop \& Keitner, 1985) and test-retest for the FAD scales were adequate (Miller, Epstein, Bishop \& Keitner, 1985)., Changes will be assessed from pre-treatment to immediately after the intervention, and also at 6-month-follow-up.","Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21; Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995)., Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) have 42 items about negative emotional symptoms (Lovibond \& Lovibond, 1995). Lovibond \& Lovinbod (1995) proposed that a part of these subscales for can become part of a short version creating a new questionnaire of 21 items. Items are rated on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (It did not happen to me) to 3 (It happened to me a lot or most of the time), and higher scores indicate worse symptoms of depression, anxiety or stress. DASS-21 showed fantastic factor structures. Regarding to the internal consistency, Cronbach's alphas were excellent for the DASS-21 subscales: Depression (α = .94), Anxiety (α = .87) and Stress (α = .91) (Antony, Bieling, Cox, Enns \& Swinson, 1998)., Changes will be assessed from pre-treatment to immediately after the intervention, and also at 6-month-follow-up.|Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS; Gratz & Roemer, 2004; Hervás & Jódar, 2008)., We used the spanish version of the instrument Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), developed by Gratz y Roemer (2004), with the aim to assess the emotional regulation problem. The scale was adapted to spanish and it was reduced from 36 items to 28 items (Hervás \& Jódar, 2008). In this version, they figured on 5 scales instead 6 considering that ""difficulties in the impulse control"" and ""limited access to regulation strategies"" were joined into one named ""emotional lack of control"". The subscales are life interference, emotional confusion, emotional rejection, emotional lack of control and lack of emotional attention. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (rarely) to 5 (almost always), and higher scores indicate greater impairment or dysregulation. The psychometric properties show high consistency were Cronbach's alphas of the subscales range from .73 to .91 and .93 for the total scale (Hervás \& Jódar, 2008)., Changes will be assessed from pre-treatment to immediately after the intervention, and also at 6-month-follow-up.|Family Empowerment Scale (FES; Koren, DeChillo & Friesen, 1992)., Family Empowerment Scale (FES) consists of 34 items divided in three subscales: family, service system, and involvement in community that is refered to three ways of empowerment, attitudes, knowledge, and behaviors (Koren, DeChillo \& Friesen, 1992).

NCT05412771,Evolutive and Functional Bases of Menstruation in Women - 2,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05412771,EVOMENS-2,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Menstruation corresponds to the shedding of the uterine lining when fecundation has not occurred. This is a recent evolutionary innovation in primates, and the cellular and genetic changes that led to the acquisition of menstruation are not well understood. Additionally, the uterine lining is poorly characterized in humans across the menstrual cycle, which hinders both evolutionary and medically-relevant analyses.

In this study, the research team are collecting uterine endometrial tissue samples from female donors undergoing uterine surgery for benign conditions, to profile gene expression and gene regulatory elements in the major cell types that compose the uterine lining during the secretive phase of the menstrual cycle. The investigators will compare this data to similar samples collected from other primates at the same time point in the female hormonal cycle.

The objective is to identify genes that have acquired novel regulation and/or expression patterns and which may be involved in menstruation, as well as better characterize the cellular and molecular pathways at work in the uterine lining of women for translational medicine purposes.",NO,Menstruation,PROCEDURE: Hysteroscopy,"Transcriptomics, Characterisation of genes involved in the evolutionary establishment of menstruation: transcriptome sequencing and identification of genes differentially expressed between menstruating and non-menstruating species in each cell type using DeSEQ analysis (FDR-corrected p-value \< 0.05), 18 months|Open chromatin analysis, Characterisation of non-coding regulatory elements specifically involved in the evolutionary establishment of menstruation: open chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) and identification of non-coding genomic regions differentially activated between menstruating and non-menstruating species in each cell type using DeSEQ analysis (FDR-corrected p-value \< 0.05), 18 months","Non-coding transcriptomics, Characterisation of non-coding transcripts expressed in the endometrium in menstruating and non-menstruating species in each cell type by transcriptome sequencing, transcript assembly and annotation of expressed non-coding transcripts in each genome, 18 months|3D cell culture - establishment, Obtaining 3D cell cultures (""organoids"") to validate the observations of the main objective: proliferation and expansion time-course assessed by bright-field microscopy, 18 months|3D cell culture - structural evaluation, Topographical evaluation of the 3D cell cultures with H/E and PAS staining, 18 months|3D cell culture - cell types evaluation, Profiling of characteristic cell markers in the 3D cell cultures via immunochemistry and immunofluorescence staining (MUC1, Cytokeratin7, EPCAM, Vimentin, CD13, ESR, PGR), 18 months|3D cell culture - gene expression, Gene expression profiling of the 3D cell cultures by PCR to compare to the transcriptomes from fresh tissues., 18 months",,"Institut National de la Santé Et de la Recherche Médicale, France",,FEMALE,ADULT,NA,20,OTHER_GOV,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: BASIC_SCIENCE,C21-20|2021-A02779-32,2022-06-19,2024-06-19,2025-07-19,2022-06-09,,2022-06-09,,

NCT02053571,Evaluation of 3D Overlay During Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) Procedure,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02053571,,COMPLETED,"The goal of this study is to evaluate an alternate approach, which involves using a 3D puncture path overlay, to access the portal vein during a Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) procedure. The study should determine if the alternate approach provides these benefits: improved safety of procedure, and reduced intervention time (including reduction of radiation exposure), which benefits both interventional radiologist and the patient.

During a TIPS procedure, a shunt or stent (mesh tube) is passed down the jugular vein (the vein above the collarbone in the neck) using fluoroscopy (x-ray) guidance. The shunt then is inserted between the portal vein (vein that carries blood from the digestive organs into the liver) to a hepatic vein (vein that carries blood away from the liver back to the heart).

In the standard approach, the interventional radiologist uses two-dimensional guidance (2D - having the dimensions of height and width only) to locate the path between the portal vein and hepatic vein. However, since these two veins do not connect, this method does not provide information on the three-dimensional (3D) relationship between the two veins.

In the alternate approach, the physician will have the option of using 3D guidance to locate the path. An on-table limited (small field of view) CT scan, used in combination with FDA approved imaging software, will provide a 3D image demonstrating the relationship between the portal vein and the hepatic vein. The 3D image is overlaid on the standard live x-ray images to assist in needle guidance during the TIPS procedure.

The CT scan performed will be in place of the angiograms that are typically performed. However, if the portal vein is not adequately seen in the CT images, the angiograms will be done and there will be no overlay.

The tested null hypothesis is that there is no difference in pain relief between the two doses.

Seventy-two patients presented for treatment at Dental University Hospital will be selected. The inclusion criteria are systemically healthy patients (ASA classification I or II), with no contraindications to corticosteroids (osteoporosis, systemic fungal infections, poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, ocular herpes simplex, primary glaucoma, allergy to corticosteroids, ulcerative colitis, a compromised immune status, and major psychosis). Patients under 18 years, pregnant or breast-feeding, took an analgesic agent within the last 6 hours, those with un-restorable teeth, teeth with periodontal disease will be excluded.

Subjects will be randomly divided into 3 groups, namely placebo (control), 20 mg prednisolone and 40 mg prednisolone according to a computerized random numbers. Each participant will receive a single oral dose of either formulation (drug or placebo) 30 minutes before starting endodontic treatment.

NCT04327271,Two-way Texting for VMMC Follow-up in Republic of South Africa,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04327271,2wT_RSA,COMPLETED,"Voluntary medical male circumcision (alternatively abbreviated in the literature as VMMC or MC) is a critical HIV prevention intervention with global support for expansion across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). MC is safe: routine programs in SSA report adverse event (AE) rates well under 2%. Nevertheless, global MC guidelines require one or more follow-up visits within 14 days for AE detection. Our prior research in Zimbabwe employed two-way texting (2wT) between patients and providers to focus follow-up on men with potential AEs, allowing men healing without complication to opt-out of routine post-operative visits. 2wT safely reduced client visits by 85%, suggesting that 2wT can make MC services dramatically more efficient while maintaining safety. In the Republic of South Africa (RSA), high-volume urban clinics, remote service delivery, and low AE identification threaten quality at scale. Across more than 500,000 annual MCs performed, up to 1 million multi-stage, unnecessary MC reviews are likely conducted. RSA pressure for MC expansion and severe health system constraints, combined with good cell coverage, suggest 2wT's impact would be significant for MC care quality and efficiency, especially in rural areas. A randomized control trial (RCT) will rigorously evaluate how 2wT improves AE ascertainment and follow-up efficiency in urban and rural clinics. We aim to conduct an RCT to determine how 2wT increases AE ascertainment while reducing workload in the RSA implementation context.

The rates will be calculated per arm as: (num moderate plus severe AEs)/(total num VMMC clients who attend 2, 7 or 14 Day follow-up visit).

NCT00982371,An Investigation Into Bone Micro-architecture in Women With Type 2 Diabetes,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00982371,,COMPLETED,"The number of people with type 2 diabetes is growing. This puts a lot of pressure on the health care systems. Type 2 diabetes is often associated with health problems, like poor eyesight, muscle coordination, muscle strength, and blood flow. Poor bone health may also be a concern for people with type 2 diabetes.

A large proportion of people with type 2 diabetes will break a bone in their lifetime. The risk of this happening in older people with type 2 diabetes is greater than the risk in older people without diabetes. Fracturing a bone can be very painful, and lead to serious consequences, especially if the individual experiences a hip fracture. The elevated fracture risk, seen in those with type 2 diabetes, is puzzling because people with type 2 diabetes often appear to have normal, healthy bones compared to people of the same age without diabetes.

Bone micro-structure, which is not assessed by traditional bone densitometry systems (ie: DXA) contributes to overall bone strength.

NCT04427371,The Effect and Mechanism of lncRNA NBR2 Regulating Endothelial Pyroptosis by Targeting GSDMD in Sepsis,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04427371,,RECRUITING,"Sepsis is a life-threatening disease characterized by multi-organ failure due to dysregulated host response to infection, with high global mortality of 30-50%. One of the most important pathophysiologic hallmarks in sepsis is vascular endothelial injury that contributes to the severity and outcome of the syndrome. Effective treatments for endothelial cell injury in sepsis have been lacking to improve prognosis. Endothelial pyroptosis is a vital mechanism of vascular endothelial injury in sepsis; mitigation or abolishment of endothelial cell pyroptosis alleviate vascular endothelial damage and improve the prognosis of sepsis mice. Gasdermin D (GSDMD) mediated endothelial pyroptosis plays a critical role in modulating vascular endothelial injury in sepsis.

Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), as a class of non-coding protein RNA longer than 200 kD, contributes to a variety of cell biological processes. The dysregulation of lncRNA results in the occurrence and development of tumors, diabetes, sepsis and other diseases. Therefore, we detected lncRNA and mRNA expression profile in 26 blood samples of septic patients using Arraystar LncRNA Microarray. We found lncRNA NBR2 regulates septic endothelial pyroptosis.

To assess any correlation of pyroptosis levels with relevant endothelial cell injury parameters and determine the prognostic value in septic patients. we measured the levels of pyroptosis in patients admitted to the Department of Critical Care Medicine for sepsis and investigated the correlation with related markers of endothelium injury.

White matter is the portion of the brain responsible for conducting electrical impulses from one area of the brain to the other. Insulating cells called myelin cover the brain and nerve cells in the white matter. If myelin becomes damaged electrical information cannot be transferred properly.

Many patients suffering from leukodystrophies do not fit the description of any of the defined types of leukodystrophies and are therefore considered to have a leukodystrophy of unknown cause.

This research aims to improve glucose metabolism in patients with T2DM thereby reducing the impact of diabetes and the subsequent risk of future cardiovascular events. The investigators propose that improved sleep health will result in improved glucose levels in participants with T2DM.

The investigators plan to use short bursts of sound (pink noise) during sleep to improve the deep-sleep phase. The study will be a 'crossover randomised controlled trial' in which two different treatments (intervention and control) are compared in all participants.

The study will be based at the University of Lincoln Sleep Laboratory. Participants will be recruited via local GP practices. Twenty five adults with T2DM who have normal sleeping patterns will be invited to attend the sleep laboratory on 3 nights, each visit separated by one week.

The primary outcome measure for this study will be the difference in mean glucose between the intervention and control periods over the first 24 hours after waking.

Participants will be fitted with sensors on their faces to measure muscle tone and eye-movements and scalps to measure brain activity (EEG) and earphones that will deliver the 'pink noise'. The first night will be a 'sham' visit with no intervention, and nights 2 and 3 will be randomised to either intervention or control. An oral glucose tolerance test will be performed on the mornings of visits 2 and 3. During visits 2 and 3 participants will be fitted with a continuous glucose monitor which will be worn for 7 days.

CAR T-cell therapy is a type of treatment in which a patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will attack cancer cells. T cells are taken from a patient's blood. Then the gene for a special receptor that binds to a certain protein on the patient's cancer cells is added to the T cells in the laboratory. The special receptor is called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). Large numbers of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion for treatment of certain cancers.

NCT04485871,Targeting Risk Factors for Diabetes in Subjects With Normal Blood Cholesterol Using Omega-3 Fatty Acids,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04485871,,RECRUITING,"Every 3 minutes a new case of diabetes is diagnosed in Canada, mostly type 2 diabetes (T2D) increasing the risk for heart disease. T2D and heart disease share many common risk factors such as aging, obesity and unhealthy lifestyle.

Paradoxically however, while lowering blood LDL, commonly known as ""bad cholesterol"", is protective against heart disease, research over the past 10 years have shown that the lower is blood LDL, the higher is the chance of developing T2D. This phenomena is happening whether blood LDL is lowered by a common drug against heart disease called Statins, or by being born with certain variations in genes, some of which are very common (\~80% of people have them).

To date, it is unclear why lowering blood LDL is associated with higher risk for diabetes, and whether this can be treated naturally with certain nutrients.

Investigators believe that lowering blood LDL by forcing LDL entry into the body tissue through their receptors promotes T2D. This is because investigators have shown that LDL entry into human fat tissue induces fat tissue dysfunction, which would promote T2D especially in subjects with excess weight.

On the other hand, investigators have shown that omega-3 fatty acids (omega-3) can directly treat the same defects induced by LDL entry into fat tissue. Omega-3 is a unique type of fat that is found mostly in fish oil.

Thus the objectives of this clinical trial to be conducted in 48 subjects with normal blood LDL are to explore if:

NCT02997371,IL-1ra Dose-range Study for Moderate-to-severe TBI Patients,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02997371,IL1ra,UNKNOWN,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common condition with high degree of morbidity and mortality (Hyder et al., 2007). Current treatment paradigms for TBI focus on mitigating secondary injury and maintaining cerebral physiology (Carney et al., 2016), however, there are currently no approved drugs that target the underlying conditions for patients suffering from TBI (Bullock et al., 1999). It is increasingly recognised that the innate inflammatory response to TBI may inflict injury (Lucas et al., 2006), and one of the most prominent mediators of inflammation in the injured brain is the Interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor pathway (Allan et al., 2005). An endogenous antagonist to IL-1, is available in recombinant form (IL-1ra, Kineret), and is known to be safe in TBI (Helmy et al., 2014).

In order to fully understand, and potentially optimize, the effect of Kineret, the investigators wish to conduct a dose-response study by giving three cohorts (n=20 per group) either placebo (isotonic saline), 1.5g or 3.0g of active substance administered intravenously in a double-blind, randomized setting. The concentrations have in previous studies not been shown to present any side-effects (Singh et al., 2014). The drug will be provided within 12 hours after trauma. The goal will be to provide a dose-response effect on the cerebral inflammatory response.

NCT05700071,MRS of Glioma Genomics,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05700071,GLIOMRS,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"In France, about 5000 new people with a primary malignant brain tumor are diagnosed each year. The most common primary tumors are gliomas, originating from glial cells (astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas). Low-grade gliomas are mildly aggressive, but they often evolve into a more malignant form.

Mutations in the genes encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) are found in about 80% of low-grade gliomas and are associated with a favorable prognosis. Remarkably, IDH-mutated gliomas are characterized by a specific cellular metabolism causing the accumulation of D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) in tumor cells. 2HG can be detected in vivo using 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and is recognized as a unique, noninvasive biomarker of IDH-mutated gliomas. Noninvasive detection of IDH mutations via 2HG MRS represents a crucial step for decision-making and patient care.

A subset of IDH-mutated tumors also presents a complete deletion of 1p and 19q chromosome arms (1p/19q codeletion). The 1p/19q codeletion is specifically linked to the oligodendroglial histologic subtype and it has been associated with a better patient outcome. However, the biological effects of this genetic alteration are still unclear and in vivo markers are lacking. Recently, we reported the first in vivo detection of the cystathionine molecule in human brain gliomas using MRS and explored the association between cystathionine accumulation and 1p/19q codeletion in gliomas.

In this project, the investigation team will combine cutting edge MRI and MRS techniques for metabolic and microstructural characterization of brain tumors with the aim of providing novel reliable noninvasive biomarkers of tumor genetic subtypes. These methods will enable noninvasive identification of IDH-mutated gliomas and, potentially, 1p/19q codeleted gliomas. In addition, the researchers will investigate the utility of 2HG, cystathionine and MRI microstructural markers to monitor tumor response to anti-cancer treatments and tumor progression.

The outputs of this project, altogether, may open new avenues to a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of oncogenesis and the design of new treatments for gliomas.",NO,Glioma,DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: MRI,"Metabolite concentrations by MRS, Concentrations of 2-hydroxyglutarate and cystahionine measured by MRS will be correlated with IDH mutational status and 1p19q codeletion derived from ex vivo analyses in tumor tissue samples, 1.5 hour","Diffusion MRI metrics, Diffusion MRI metrics will be correlated with the 1p19q codeletion status derived from ex vivo analyses in tumor tissue samples, 1,5 hours|Metabolic changes during an anti-tumor treatment, The changes in concentration of 2-hydroxyglutarate, cystathionine and choline will be compared to the changes in tumor volumes and to the clinical response, 1 year|Diffusion MRI and amide proton transfer signal changes during an anti-tumor treatment., Diffusion MRI and amide proton transfer signal changes will be compared to the changes in metabolism, tumor volumes and to the clinical response, 1 year",,"Institut National de la Santé Et de la Recherche Médicale, France",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,80,OTHER_GOV,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: BASIC_SCIENCE,C21-27|2021-A03015-36,2023-02-15,2026-11-24,2026-11-24,2023-01-26,,2023-01-30,"Pitié-Salpetrière Hospital, Paris, 75013, France",

It belongs to the paramyxovirus family and is genetically close to the Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). hMPV has a seasonal epidemic pattern, between January to April. Clinical symptoms of hMPV infection include influenza-like illness (fever, asthenia and curvatures) associated with signs of respiratory tract infection. The incidence of hMPV infection is higher in children than in adults. In child pneumonia, hMPV is the third most frequent isolated pathogen (14 % of the subjects), after rhinovirus and RSV. In hospitalized adults, hMPV was detected in 6 to 8% of the subjects with lower respiratory tract and in 4 % of subjects with pneumonia.

Clinical, radiological and biological features, as well as evolution course of hMPV infections have been mainly described in children. Clinical presentation of in adult seems polymorph, ranging from acute bronchitis or exacerbation of COPD to pneumonia. The frequency of viral-bacterial coinfection is unknown. Intensive care unit (ICU) admission may involve almost 1 for 10 patients. Elderly and immunocompromised subjects are probably high-risk subjects.

Currently, treatment of hMPV infections is mainly symptomatic. However, several anti-RSV drugs that are currently in clinical development have demonstrated an activity against other paramyxoviridae in pre-clinical studies. Consequently, it seems necessary to better characterize hMPV infections in adult inpatients: presentation, course profile and risk factors for morbidity and mortality. These data would help clinicians to identify high risk patients, and consequently to choose those who could benefit from coming treatments.

The French hMPV Study is observational prospective multicenter clinical study. The study population includes all consecutive adult inpatients with a community-acquired acute lower respiratory tract infection and a mPCR positive for hMPV on any respiratory sample. The primary objective is to describe the prognosis. The secondary objectives are i) to characterize clinical, radiological and biological features, ii) to describe the hospital course and the rate of ICU transfer; in ICU patients, to describe organ failures and supports, and iii) to describe the viral and/or bacterial coinfections.

Aims: The aim of this study is to determine the pain reduction effectiveness of ice bag applications to the femoral region in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.

Design: A randomized controlled trial with repeated measures and two-group design.

Setting: This study was conducted at the Yilmaz-Mehmet Oztaskın Heart and Vascular Hospital located in Kayseri, Turkey.

Participants: The study was completed with a total of 104 patients who met the inclusion criteria: 52 each in the experimental group and the control group.

Methods: The data were collected by the researcher using Patient Identification Form, Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), and Vital Signs Monitoring Form. An ice bag was applied to patients in the experimental group for 20 minutes before removal of the catheter. The nurse performing the application was also responsible for the catheter removal, immediately after the ice bag was removed. Standard procedures of the clinic were applied to the control group.

In patients with high-grade gliomas, changes on standard MRI of the brain may reflect true tumor growth or inflammatory changes in response to treatment, called pseudo-progression. It is important to distinguish true tumor growth from inflammation since inflammation indicates the tumor is responding to treatment. With standard MRI, it is difficult to determine if changes following treatment are due to tumor growth or inflammation early on.

NCT01618071,Vascular Effects of Triglyceride-rich Lipoproteins,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01618071,,COMPLETED,Many types of cardiovascular disease begin when the layer of cells lining blood vessels (endothelial cells) start to function abnormally. This causes white blood cells (monocytes) to enter the blood vessel wall and eventually form lesions. Fats from foods we consume are carried in the blood for 3-8 hours after a fatty meal in small particles known as chylomicrons (CM) and chylomicron remnants (CMR). The overall aim of this project is to investigate the idea that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) protect against heart disease by modifying the effect of CMR on endothelial cells and monocytes.

This can affect the children by limiting their opportunities for participation in school activities. Previous studies indicate a link between childhood SPD, childhood anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in adulthood. Research and clinical experience suggest that systematic use of proprioceptive-tactile stimulant aids may have a positive effect for children with SPD.

The aim of the project is to investigate and describe the effects of a systematic use of proprioceptive-tactile stimulating vest, MyFit®, for children 6-12 years with SPD in the form of sensory-seeking behaviour.

Research questions:

* Can systematic use of MyFit® for children with sensory seeking behaviour increase their participation in school activities?
* Can systematic use of MyFit® support children with sensory seeking behaviour to increase their awareness, concentration and focus on tasks?
* Can systematic use of MyFit® affect children's feelings of confidence and self-efficacy? The project seeks to answer these questions to contribute to knowledge on how children with sensory seeking behaviours can be supported for better participation in school activities.

NCT04127071,Abscess Aspiration,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04127071,,UNKNOWN,"Incision and drainage (I\&D) is the standard guideline treatment of uncomplicated skin abscesses (a boil or bumo beneath the skin). Ultrasound-guided needle aspiration (USGNA) is a minimally invasive and less painful alternative treatment, but has not been validated as non-inferior to I\&D. Multiple studies have shown successful treatment with USGNA of breast, face, neck, and/or trunk abscesses in combination with oral antibiotics with success rates as high as 97%.

In 2011 Gaspari et al. published a landmark article on the use of USGNA for skin abscesses. In this randomized controlled trial, USGNA and I\&D had failure rates of 74% and 20% respectively, which makes USGNA an unappealing treatment option. However, the study had several methodological issues that likely biased the results in favor of I\&D, including the following: 1) aspiration was performed with an 18-gauge needle which is often too small to aspirate thick purulence (or pus); 2) failure to fully aspirate all abscess contents was a priori defined as treatment failure rather than strictly clinical outcomes; 3) the abscess aspiration procedure was not standardized; and 4) post-intervention oral antibiotic therapy was not used on all patients.

The main hypothesis is that a modified protocol of the Gaspari et al. USGNA study to address these flaws will demonstrate a failure of USGNA comparable to I\&D for the treatment of uncomplicated skin abscesses. First, the study will standardize the use of larger 14-gauge needle on all USGNAs. Second, USGNA intervention failure need not be defined as the inability to completely aspirate all abscess cavity contents under ultrasound guidance. Previous studies have demonstrated clinical success with USGNA of skin abscesses without applying the rigid failure criteria chosen by Gaspari et al. There is only one study in the literature to suggest that there is no correlation between a small quantity of residual abscess contents post-USGNA and ultimate clinical failure, however, there are no studies which specifically address this clinical question. In this study, initial treatment failure of USGNA will be defined as the inability to aspirate any purulent material. Third, treatment outcomes in this study will be determined by clinical resolution of abscess at the study endpoint of 7-10 days, which is a well-established timeline for anticipated abscess healing and endpoint clinical follow-up. Fourth, ultrasound fellowship-trained emergency physicians will perform USGNA in standardized fashion on all enrolled patients. Lastly, post-intervention oral antibiotic with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) coverage will be provided and compliance closely monitored throughout the study.",NO,Skin Abscess,PROCEDURE: Ultrasound-guided Needle Aspiration Procedure|PROCEDURE: Incision and Drainage (I&D),"Abscess cure or treatment failure, Treatment cure will be defined by the complete resolution of the abscess based on clinical signs and symptoms (no or minimal tenderness, erythema, fever, wound drainage, warmth, fluctuance, or induration) at the 7- to 10-day follow-up. Treatment failure will be defined by: fever (attributable to the infection), persistent or increased size \>25% of the original abscess, requiring conversion to I\&D (USGNA intervention group) or repeat I\&D (I\&D intervention group), requiring additional antibiotics, or requiring hospital admission within 7-10 days after treatment.

NCT04702971,Decoding Pain Sensitivity in Migraine With Multimodal Brainstem-based Neurosignature,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04702971,,RECRUITING,"Migraine is a highly prevalent and disabling neurological disease, which has a tremendous impact on sufferers, healthcare systems, and the economy. According to the 2016 WHO report, migraine is the second leading cause of years lived with disability, greater than all other neurological diseases combined. Yet, the treatment in migraine is far from optimum; the sufferers often abuse painkillers and complicated with medication overuse headache. Migraine is characterized by the hypersensitivity of the sensory system, potentially attributed to dysfunctional pain modulatory networks located in the deep brain structures, particularly the brainstem. However, the current understanding of these deeply seated, dysregulated pain modulatory circuits in migraine is limited due to technological constraints. Besides, studies with an in-depth analysis of the clinical manifestations (i.e., deep phenotyping) are lacking, and there is no corresponding animal model readily available for translational research. In this project, the investigators propose a multimodal approach to address these issues by applying the technologies and platforms developed by our team to explore the correlation between pain sensitivity and dysregulated connectivities from brainstem to other brain regions. In this four-year project, the investigators will recruit 400 migraine patients and 200 healthy subjects. The investigators aim at decomposing the key brainstem mechanisms underlying dysmodulated pain sensitivity in migraine from 5 comprehensive perspectives: (1) clinical deep phenotyping, (2) high-resolution brainstem structural MRI and functional connectivity analysis, (3) innovative brainstem EEG signal detecting technique, (4) multimodal data fusion platform with neural network analysis, and (5) ultrahigh-resolution brainstem-based connectomes, intravital manipulations and recording, and connectome-sequencing in animal models. Moreover, the investigators will collaborate with Taiwan Semiconductor Research Institute to develop a wearable high-density EEG equipment, integrated with a System-on-Chip capable of edge-computing the signal using algorithms derived from our brainstem decoding platform.

NCT03626571,PET/MR Imaging In Patients With Infective Endocarditis,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03626571,,UNKNOWN,"PET scanning (positron emission tomography) is a well-established technique used to identify areas of interest within the body. It involves injecting a radioactive tracer which highlights abnormal areas. It has recently been combined with CT (computed tomography) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scanning to more accurately identify abnormalities within the heart. Infective endocarditis (infection of the heart valves or lining of the heart) and device infection (where a pacemaker device or wire becomes infected) are of particular interest in this area.

The study makes use of hybrid PET/MR scanning using a designated scanner which enables PET scanning combined with MRI scanning. PET scanning combined with CT scanning will be used instead for patients who aren't able to undergo MRI scanning. This will allow abnormal areas within the heart in these conditions to be characterised, alongside treatment regimens, in a way which hasn't been done before.

All participants will undergo PET scanning, where a radioactive tracer is injected into a vein before the scan. The radioactive substance only lasts for a short time, passed out of the body in urine. Patients with infective endocarditis involving their own heart valve will undergo an MRI scan as part of the PET scan. Patients with infective endocarditis involving a metal or prosthetic heart valve and also patients who have pacemaker infections, instead of an MRI, will have a CT scan. The reason for this is that CT is better for looking at metal and prosthetic heart valves and patients with pacemakers can't have MRI scans because the strong magnet in the scanner can affect the pacemaker. The scan will be performed twice; once before treatment and once after treatment has been established.

If successful, this imaging method will play a key role in diagnosing, quantifying and monitoring these conditions.",NO,Infective Endocarditis,OTHER: 18F-FDG,"Myocardial 18F-FDG uptake, Quantification of myocardial PET tracer uptake, early and late time-points, 1 year",,,University of Edinburgh,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,60,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,AC17012,2018-05-01,2019-05-31,2019-05-31,2018-08-13,,2018-08-13,"Queen's Medical Research Institute, Edinburgh, Midlothian, EH16 4TJ, United Kingdom",

Prevention and treatment measures for cognitive decline in persons with T2DM has not been well studied.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a member of an endogenous class of incretin hormones synthesized in intestinal epithelial L-cells.GLP-1 enhances glucose-dependent secretion of insulin,inhibits glucagon secretion, slows gastric emptying and reduces food intake. Liraglutide is a glucagon-like peptide type 1 (GLP-1) analogue. It has been proved that Liraglutide can improve insulin resistance and cognitive function in AD animals. Therefore, it is speculated that Liraglutide may interfere with the occurrence and development of cognitive dysfunction in patients with T2DM. In order to confirm the effects, the investigators conduct an open, prospective, positive controlled study in patients with T2DM. The effect on BMI,waist circumference, hip circumference, waist-to-hip ratio,fasting plasma glucose，glycosylated hemoglobin,blood lipids and cognitive function were measured to explore the effects of liraglutide in patients with T2DM.

NCT00680771,The Psychoneuroimmunology of Insomnia,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00680771,,COMPLETED,"Chronic insomnia affects approximately 8-9% of the population. The prevalence of this disorder rises dramatically across the lifespan, especially so in women. When it is chronic, insomnia is associated with increased fatigue, cognitive impairment, mood disturbance, physical complaints, diminished quality of life and increased health care consumption. There is also more limited evidence (based on epidemiologic studies or experimental studies in healthy subjects) that insomnia and/or sleep loss may be a risk factor for hypertension and/or cardiovascular disease and increased mortality.

Despite its prevalence and consequences, the pathophysiology of insomnia and, specifically, the pathway by which morbidity risk is conferred, has been relatively unstudied. With respect to medical illness in particular, insomnia may confer risk in several ways, including: 1) an inherent compromise in the restorative/conservative function of sleep, 2) the deleterious effects of ""hyperarousal"" and/or HPA axis abnormalities on end organ integrity and function, and/or 3) diminished immunocompetence. This study focuses on the last of these possibilities, the relationship between immune function and sleep.

The study compares immune response to a vaccine challenge in two groups: good sleepers and patients with chronic insomnia. The primary study hypothesis is that the insomnia group will have a decreased rate of adaptive immune response to the vaccine challenge than that of the good sleeper group.",YES,Primary Insomnia,,"Positive Antibody Response, Sero-Response to the Hepatitis B vaccine, defined as reaching or exceeding a Hepatitis B surface antigen level of greater than or equal to 10mIU/mL., 3 Months after initial vaccination",,,University of Rochester,National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR),FEMALE,ADULT,,28,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,RSRB # 19132|1K23NR010408,2008-03,2010-07,2010-07,2008-05-20,2011-09-26,2012-10-17,"University of Rochester Sleep Research Laboratory, Rochester, New York, 14642, United States",
NCT04116671,Stimulation Combined With Powered Motorized Orthoses for Walking After Stroke,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04116671,,RECRUITING,"Objective: The goal of this study is to implement and test a neuro-mechanical gait assist (NMGA) device to correct walking characterized by muscle weakness, incoordination or excessive tone in Veterans with hemiparesis after stroke that adversely affects their ability to walk, exercise, perform activities of daily living, and participate fully in personal, professional and social roles.

Research Plan: A prototype NMGA device will be used to develop a finite state controller (FSC) to coordinate each user's volitional effort with surface muscle stimulation and motorized knee assistance as needed. Brace mounted sensors will be used to develop a gait event detector (GED) which will serve the FSC to advance through the phases of gait or stair climbing. In addition, a rule-base intent detection algorithm will be developed using brace mounted sensors and user interface input to select among various functions including walking, stairs climbing, sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit maneuvers. The FSC controller tuning and intent algorithm development and evaluation will be on pilot subjects with difficulty walking after stroke. Outcome measures during development will provide specifications for a new prototype NMGA design which will be evaluated on pilot subjects to test the hypothesis that the NMGA improves walking speed, distance and energy consumption of walking. These baseline data and device will be used to design a follow-up clinical trial to measure orthotic impact of NMGA on mobility in activities of daily living at home and community.

Methodology: After meeting inclusion criteria, pilot subjects will undergo baseline gait evaluation with EMG activities of knee flexors and extensors, ankle plantar and dorsiflexors and isokinetic knee strength and passive resistance. They will be fitted with a NMGA combining a knee-ankle-foot-orthosis with a motorized knee joint and surface neuromuscular stimulation of plantar- and dorsi- flexors, vasti and rectus femoris. Brace mounted sensor data will be used for gait event detector (GED) algorithm development and evaluation. The GED will serve the FSC to proceed through phases of gait based on supervisory rule-based user intent recognition algorithm detected by brace mounted sensors and user input interface. The FSC will coordinate feed-forward control of tuned stimulation patterns and closed-loop controlled knee power assist as needed to control foot clearance during swing and stability of the knee during stance. Based on data attained during controller development and evaluation, a new prototype NMGA will be design, constructed and evaluated on pilot subjects to test the hypothesis that a NMGA device improves safety and stability, increases walking speed and distance and minimizes user effort.

Clinical Significance: The anticipated outcome is improved gait stability with improved swing knee flexion, thus, increasing the safety and preventing injurious falls of ambulatory individuals with hemiplegia due to stroke found in large and ever-increasing numbers in the aging Veteran population.
